The existing priority_v0 uses the negative log of the ratio of the item size to the bin capacities. The goal is to minimize the number of bins used. Let me think about alternative heuristics and how to parameterize them.\n\nFirst, the original approach. The priority_v0 assigns higher priority to bins where the item-to-bin ratio is small. Wait, because when you take the log of item/bin and then negate it, smaller ratios (item is much smaller than bin) would have higher log values (since log of a small number is a large negative, and negating makes it positive). Wait, no. Let's see. If the bin is almost full, bins[i] is small, so item/bin is large. Taking log(ratios) would be larger, and the priority is -log, so that would be a lower priority. Hmm, maybe the original idea is that bins with more remaining capacity (so bins[i] is larger) would give a smaller item/bin ratio, leading to a larger priority. So higher priority is given to bins where the item fits well, but maybe not too tightly. Wait, maybe the idea is to prioritize bins where the item fills them as much as possible. Or maybe it's the opposite. Let me check with example numbers.\n\nSuppose bins have capacities [5, 10], and the item is 3. Then ratios are 3/5=0.6, 3/10=0.3. Log of 0.6 is negative, log of 0.3 is more negative. So priorities would be -log(0.6) \u2248 0.51, -log(0.3) \u2248 1.20. So the priority is higher for the bin with 10 capacity. Wait, that's counterintuitive. Because putting the item into the 5-capacity bin (assuming current capacity is 5, so after adding 3, remaining is 2) would leave less space. Whereas putting it into 10 leaves more. But according to this priority, the larger bin gets a higher priority. That might lead to items being placed in larger bins first, which isn't optimal because you want to fill up bins as much as possible. Hmm, maybe the original priority function isn't working as intended. Or perhaps the bins array represents remaining capacities, not total capacities. Wait, the docstring says \"bins: Array of capacities for each bin.\" Wait, maybe the bin's current capacity is what's in the array. But if it's the total capacity, then this approach might not be correct. Wait, in bin packing, typically you track the remaining capacity. So maybe the bins array here is the remaining capacity of each bin. Then, when you add an item, you subtract the item size from the remaining capacity. Oh right, so the bins array here probably represents the remaining capacities. So for example, a bin with remaining capacity 5 can take an item of size up to 5.\n\nIn that case, the priority_v0 function's ratio is item / remaining capacity. If the item is exactly fitting, the ratio is 1. So log(1) is 0, priority is 0. But if the item is much smaller than the remaining capacity, the ratio is small, log is negative, so priority is positive. Wait, so in the previous example, if a bin has a remaining capacity of 5 (can take the item of size 3), the ratio is 0.6. Log(0.6) is negative, so priority is positive. If another bin has remaining capacity 10, ratio is 0.3, log is more negative, priority is higher. So the priority function is assigning higher priority to bins with larger remaining capacities. That seems backwards. Because you want to put items into bins where they fit snugly. So maybe the original priority function is not effective. Oh wait, maybe the logic is inverted. The original function might have a mistake.\n\nWait, if the priority is -log(ratio), and ratio is item / remaining capacity, then higher priority would be given to bins where the ratio is small. Which would be bins with larger remaining capacity. But that's not what we want. We want to put items into bins where the remaining capacity is just enough, to minimize fragmentation. So for example, Best Fit places the item into the bin with the smallest remaining capacity that can hold the item. So if the item is 3, and bins have remaining capacities 5, 4, 2, then Best Fit would pick the bin with remaining 4 (if 3 fits; but 4 can take 3, leaving 1). So Best Fit picks the tightest possible fit.\n\nBut the original priority function is giving higher priority to bins that have larger remaining capacities. That would be like a Worst Fit approach, where you place the item in the bin with the most space, which is known to perform worse in terms of minimizing bins. So perhaps the original priority_v0 is not a good approach, and there's a need to redesign.\n\nSo the user wants to improve upon this. The new priority_v1 should be better. Let's think of alternative heuristics.\n\nAlternative Heuristic Formulations:\n\n1. Best Fit: Assign higher priority to bins where (remaining_capacity - item) is smallest and non-negative. So priority could be (remaining_capacity - item) after placement. So lower values (tighter fits) are better. But for the priority score, perhaps the negative of (remaining_capacity - item), so higher priority is given when this is smaller.\n\nWait, but we need a score where higher values mean higher priority. So if we compute (remaining_capacity - item) after placing the item (so remaining_capacity is the current remaining capacity, so after placing, new remaining is (remaining - item). So the priority could be -(remaining - item) if remaining >= item. So for example, if a bin has remaining 5, item is 3, then after placement, remaining is 2. The priority would be -2. But maybe we need to invert it. Alternatively, we can use the inverse: 1/(remaining - item + epsilon) to avoid division by zero. So bins that leave very little remaining space get higher priority.\n\nBut how to compute this. The priority could be 1/(remaining_capacity - item + 1e-9) if remaining >= item. For bins where the item doesn't fit, we can assign a very low priority or exclude them. But the priority function must handle that.\n\nBut in the current setup, the bins are passed as capacities. So perhaps in the code, the function first checks if the item can fit into each bin. But maybe in the current code, the bins array is already the remaining capacities, and the item is being placed only into bins where it fits. Or maybe the priority function is supposed to return a score, and the algorithm would then select the bin with the highest priority that can accommodate the item. So perhaps the priority function returns a value for each bin, but the algorithm ignores bins where the item can't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the priority function could return -infinity for bins where the item doesn't fit. But the code provided for priority_v0 doesn't handle that. So perhaps the bins array represents the current remaining capacities, and the code is part of a selection process where the item is placed into the bin with the highest priority score among those bins where the item fits (i.e., item <= bin's remaining capacity).\n\nBut given that, the priority_v0's approach might not be effective. So the improved priority_v1 should use a better heuristic.\n\nSo possible approaches for priority_v1:\n\n- Best Fit: Assign priority based on the remaining capacity after placing the item. The smaller the remaining capacity (without being negative), the higher the priority. So for a bin with remaining capacity c, if item <= c, then priority is (c - item). Then, lower values are better. So the priority could be -(c - item) so that higher values (smaller (c - item)) are better.\n\nWait, (c - item) is the remaining space after placing the item. If that's small, then the bin is a tight fit. So priority should be higher for smaller (c - item). So the priority could be 1 / (c - item + epsilon) to make sure that bins with the smallest remaining space have higher priority.\n\nBut this is the best fit approach. Alternatively, considering the original code's approach, maybe there's a different way. Alternatively, combining multiple factors.\n\nDynamic Adjustment Mechanisms:\n\nMaybe the priority could adapt based on the current state of the bins. For example, if many bins are nearly full, prioritize different heuristics. Or adjust parameters based on the average remaining capacity.\n\nContext-aware Decision Branching:\n\nDepending on the distribution of item sizes (uniform, skewed), switch between best fit, worst fit, or other heuristics. For example, if items are skewed towards larger sizes, use a first-fit approach.\n\nParameterization:\n\nWe need to make the new priority function tunable. For example, the heuristic could combine multiple factors, each with a weight that can be tuned. For example, a weighted sum of the reciprocal of remaining space after placement and the log ratio.\n\nPossible steps for priority_v1:\n\n1. Check if the item can fit into each bin (remaining capacity >= item). For bins that can't fit, assign a very low priority (like -infinity).\n\n2. For bins that can fit, compute a score that combines factors like:\n\n   a. Remaining space after placement (c - item). Smaller values (tighter fits) get higher priority. For example, 1/(c - item + epsilon).\n\n   b. The current utilization of the bin. For example, (original capacity - remaining + item) / original capacity. Wait, but we may not have the original capacity. Hmm, unless the bins track their original capacity. But if the bins array only has remaining capacities, that's not possible. So maybe this factor isn't available.\n\n   c. The item's size relative to the bin's remaining capacity. Like item / c. A higher ratio (closer to 1) would be better. So priority could be item / c.\n\n   d. A combination of these factors, weighted by tunable parameters.\n\nSo for example, the priority could be a tunable combination of the reciprocal remaining space and the item/bin ratio.\n\nAnother idea: For each bin that can accommodate the item, compute the score as (item_size / bin_capacity_remaining) * tunable_weight1 + (1 / (bin_capacity_remaining - item_size + 1e-9)) * tunable_weight2. Then apply some normalization or scaling.\n\nBut how to parameterize this. Let's think of possible tunable elements.\n\nTunable elements could include:\n\n- The choice of heuristic (e.g., best fit, worst fit, hybrid).\n\n- Weights for combining different factors.\n\n- Thresholds for dynamic adjustments, like if the remaining capacity is below a certain threshold, use a different heuristic.\n\n- Exponents in the formula (like using item/bin raised to a power).\n\nSo, the improved priority_v1 could look like:\n\nFor each bin:\n\nif bin can fit the item:\n\n   score = (item / bin_capacity) ** tunable([1, 2, 0.5]) + tunable([0.0, 0.5, 1.0]) * (1 / (bin_capacity - item + 1e-9))\n\nelse:\n\n   score = -inf\n\nBut the code needs to handle this. Also, maybe we can add dynamic adjustment. For example, if the average remaining capacity is high, prioritize fitting into larger bins to minimize fragmentation. If most bins are almost full, prioritize tight fits.\n\nBut integrating dynamic elements would require tracking some state, which might not be possible in a function that's called per item. Alternatively, the function could compute some statistics from the current bins array.\n\nAnother idea: use a weighted sum between the original log-based priority and a best-fit approach. The weights could be tunable.\n\nAlternatively, add a parameter to decide the heuristic:\n\nif item > tunable([0.5, 0.7]) * average_bin_capacity:\n\n   use best fit\n\nelse:\n\n   use worst fit\n\nBut the average bin capacity would be the mean of the bins array. But how to compute that.\n\nBut perhaps the function can compute some statistics of the bins array on the fly.\n\nPutting this together, here's a possible approach for priority_v1:\n\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    remaining_after = bins - item\n    valid = remaining_after >= 0\n    # Compute best fit component: 1/(remaining_after + epsilon)\n    best_fit = np.where(valid, 1 / (remaining_after + 1e-9), -np.inf)\n    # Compute ratio component: item / bins\n    ratio = np.where(valid, item / bins, -np.inf)\n    # Combine components with tunable weights\n    combined = tunable([0.5, 1.0, 2.0]) * ratio + tunable([0.5, 1.0, 2.0]) * best_fit\n    # Alternatively, dynamic adjustment based on remaining capacity\n    # For example, if average remaining capacity is low, use more best fit\n    avg_remaining = np.mean(bins)\n    weight = np.where(avg_remaining < tunable([0.3, 0.5]), tunable([0.7, 0.9]), tunable([0.3, 0.5]))\n    combined = weight * best_fit + (1 - weight) * ratio\n    return combined\n\nBut integrating dynamic adjustments would require more complex code. Maybe use a tunable threshold for average remaining capacity to switch between heuristics.\n\nAlternatively, use a branch: if the item size is above a certain percentile of the bins' remaining capacities, use one heuristic, else another.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let's think of a simpler version that combines factors and is highly parameterized.\n\nAnother approach: use a hybrid score that can be tuned between best fit and the original ratio approach.\n\nFor example:\n\nscore = (item / bins) ** tunable([1, 2]) - tunable([0.0, 0.1]) * (remaining_after)\n\nThis would give higher priority to higher item/bin ratios (like the original approach) but subtract a term based on remaining after, encouraging tighter fits. The weights here are tunable.\n\nAlternatively, use a tunable exponent to balance between different factors.\n\nBut I need to make sure the code can handle these, and that all the parameters are marked with tunable.\n\nAnother idea is to use a dynamic adjustment based on the remaining capacity of the bin. For example, if the remaining capacity after placing the item is below a certain threshold, prioritize those bins. Or give a bonus to such bins.\n\nLike: if (remaining_after < tunable([0.2, 0.5])) then add a tunable([5.0, 10.0]) to the score.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nPutting all this together, here's a possible implementation for priority_v1:\n\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    remaining_after = bins - item\n    valid_mask = remaining_after >= 0\n    # Initialize priorities to negative infinity for invalid bins\n    priorities = np.full_like(bins, -np.inf)\n    \n    # Calculate base score components for valid bins\n    valid_bins = valid_mask.nonzero()[0]\n    if valid_bins.size == 0:\n        return priorities\n    \n    # Component 1: Best fit (inverse of remaining after)\n    best_fit = 1.0 / (remaining_after[valid_bins] + 1e-9)\n    \n    # Component 2: Original ratio score (item/bin)\n    ratio = item / bins[valid_bins]\n    \n    # Component 3: Dynamic weight based on item size distribution (example: if item is large)\n    if item > tunable([0.3, 0.5, 0.7]) * np.max(bins):\n        # Prefer best fit more when item is large\n        weight = tunable([0.7, 0.9])\n    else:\n        weight = tunable([0.3, 0.5])\n    combined_score = weight * best_fit + (1 - weight) * ratio\n    \n    # Apply exponent to ratio component as tunable parameter\n    ratio_component_exponent = tunable([1, 2, 0.5])\n    ratio = ratio ** ratio_component_exponent\n    \n    # Alternatively, combine with multiplicative factors\n    combined_score = tunable([0.5, 1.0, 2.0]) * ratio + tunable([0.5, 1.0, 2.0]) * best_fit\n    \n    # Apply bonus to bins that will be nearly full after placement\n    remaining_after_valid = remaining_after[valid_bins]\n    bonus_mask = remaining_after_valid < tunable([0.1, 0.2])\n    combined_score[bonus_mask] += tunable([5.0, 10.0])\n    \n    priorities[valid_bins] = combined_score\n    return priorities\n\nBut this code has multiple tunable parameters, like weights, exponents, thresholds for dynamic branching, and bonus values. Each of these can be marked with tunable().\n\nAnother possibility: the priority could be a weighted sum of multiple terms, each scaled by a tunable weight. For example:\n\nscore = (\n    tunable([0.0, 1.0, 2.0]) * (item / bins) \n    + tunable([0.0, 1.0, 2.0]) * (1 / (remaining_after + 1e-9)) \n    + tunable([0.0, 0.5]) * (bins - item)\n)\n\nBut the terms need to be normalized or scaled appropriately.\n\nAlternatively, use exponents to adjust the impact of each term. For example, (item / bins) raised to a tunable exponent.\n\nBut the code should handle cases where bins can't fit the item. Also, using numpy operations for efficiency.\n\nPutting all together, here's a possible code:\n\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    remaining_after = bins - item\n    valid = remaining_after >= 0\n    # Base score components\n    ratio_score = np.where(valid, item / bins, -np.inf)\n    best_fit_score = np.where(valid, 1 / (remaining_after + 1e-9), -np.inf)\n    # Dynamic adjustment based on remaining capacity\n    avg_remaining = np.mean(bins)\n    if avg_remaining < tunable([0.2, 0.3]):\n        # When average remaining is low, prioritize best fit more\n        weight = tunable([0.7, 0.9])\n    else:\n        weight = tunable([0.3, 0.5])\n    combined = weight * best_fit_score + (1 - weight) * ratio_score\n    # Apply exponent to ratio score\n    ratio_exponent = tunable([1.0, 2.0])\n    ratio_score = ratio_score ** ratio_exponent\n    # Add bonus for bins that will be almost full\n    remaining_after_valid = np.where(valid, remaining_after, np.inf)\n    bonus = np.where(remaining_after_valid < tunable([0.1, 0.2]), tunable([5.0, 10.0]), 0)\n    combined += bonus\n    # Context-aware branching based on item size distribution (example)\n    if item > np.percentile(bins, tunable([75, 90])):\n        combined = tunable([1.0, 2.0]) * best_fit_score\n    return np.where(valid, combined, -np.inf)\n\nWait, but this code has multiple conditional branches with tunable parameters, which can complicate things, but it's allowed as per the user's request.\n\nAnother point to consider: the original priority_v0 returns priorities for all bins, including those that can't fit the item. But perhaps in practice, the algorithm would only consider bins where the item fits. But the function still has to return priorities for all bins. So using -infinity for invalid bins makes sense, as those would be ignored in practice.\n\nIn this code, the tunable parameters are introduced in various places:\n\n- Weight between best_fit_score and ratio_score based on average remaining capacity.\n\n- Thresholds for average remaining capacity to switch weighting.\n\n- Exponents for the ratio score.\n\n- Bonus thresholds and amounts.\n\n- Percentile thresholds for context-aware branching.\n\nEach of these can be marked with tunable().\n\nSo, integrating all these ideas into the code with appropriate tunable parameters.\n\nBut perhaps the code can be written with multiple tunable options, allowing different heuristics to be selected based on parameters.\n\nThe final code would need to handle valid bins, compute multiple components, combine them with tunable weights or parameters, and possibly apply dynamic adjustments based on the current state of the bins.\n\nThus, the improved priority_v1 function can be structured to include these elements, with tunable parameters at each decision point.\n", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1741077784, "id": "021741077556088ef2a64566bdd4cc27e9c7fa76499a18f35c475", "model": "deepseek-r1-250120", "service_tier": "default", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 5419, "prompt_tokens": 516, "total_tokens": 5935, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 4526}}}
