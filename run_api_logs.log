-- [256.0] -- GPT-4o-mini ----sample--------
To create an improved version of the priority function for constructing 8-dimensional cap sets, we need to develop a priority strategy that considers both the balance of dimensions and the diversity of selected vectors. We can introduce a few parameters that will allow us to fine-tune the selection strategy.

Here’s an example of how we can implement `priority_v1` with a novel vector priority strategy. The function will include an inner helper function to calculate the diversity of a vector based on the distribution of its components and exposure of tunable parameters for flexibility in adjusting the strategy.

```python
import numpy as np
from typing import List, Tuple

def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...]) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0` with a novel vector priority strategy."""

    # Parameters that can be tuned
    axis_balance_weight = 0.3  # Example tunable
    diversity_weight = 0.7      # Example tunable

    def calculate_diversity(vector: tuple[int, ...]) -> float:
        """Calculates the diversity of the vector based on the distribution of its components."""
        unique_elements, counts = np.unique(vector, return_counts=True)
        diversity = len(unique_elements)  # Count of unique elements in the vector
        max_count = np.max(counts)         # The highest frequency of any component
        return diversity / (max_count + 1)  # Normalized diversity score

    def calculate_balance(vector: tuple[int, ...]) -> float:
        """Calculates a balance score based on the distribution of elements."""
        counts = np.bincount(vector, minlength=3)  # Assume elements are 0, 1, 2
        total = sum(counts)
        if total == 0:
            return 0.0
        balance = np.std(counts) / total  # Standard deviation to measure balance
        return balance

    # Calculate diversity and balance
    diversity = calculate_diversity(el)
    balance = calculate_balance(el)

    # Combine the scores with weights
    priority_score = (diversity_weight * diversity) + (axis_balance_weight * balance)
    
    return priority_score

# Example usage
el = (1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1, 1)
print(priority_v1(el))  # Should output the priority score based on the novel strategy
```

### Explanation
1. **Diversity Calculation**: This function computes the number of unique components in the vector normalized by the maximum occurrence of any element. The idea is that vectors with a broad diversity of components should be prioritized.

2. **Balance Calculation**: This function evaluates how evenly distributed the components are. A more balanced vector should have lower standard deviation in its component counts, which we approximate as a measure of balance.

3. **Combining Scores**: The final priority score combines the weighted diversity and balance scores. This allows us to emphasize one aspect over the other through tuning parameters.

4. **Adjustable Parameters**: We define `axis_balance_weight` and `diversity_weight` as tunable parameters that can be modified to influence the behavior of vector selection.

This implementation provides a structured approach to vector prioritization suitable for 8-dimensional cap sets, focusing on balancing diversity and dimensional distribution.

    Returns:
        Priority score determining selection order in greedy algorithm. Higher
        values indicate the vector should be considered earlier.
    """
    n = 8
    if len(el) != n:
        raise ValueError(f"Vector must be {n}-dimensional")
    
    # Calculate balance score: how evenly distributed are the components?
    counts = np.bincount(el, minlength=3)
    balance = np.max(counts) / np.min(counts) if np.min(counts) != 0 else 0
    
    # Calculate diversity score: how varied are the components?
    diversity = len(set(el)) / 3  # 0 to 1
    
    # Combine scores with tunable parameters
    balance_weight = tunable([0.4])  # Weight for balance
    diversity_weight = tunable([0.6])  # Weight for diversity
    
    score = (balance * balance_weight) + (diversity * diversity_weight)
    
    return score

# Example usage with tunable parameters:
# axis_balance_weight = tunable([0.1, 0.3, 0.5])
# sorted(elements, key=lambda x: priority_v1(x, axis_balance_weight=axis_balance_weight))
```

### Explanation:

1. **Balance Score**: This measures how evenly the components of the vector are distributed. A lower score indicates more balance (closer to equal counts of 0s, 1s, and 2s).

2. **Diversity Score**: This measures how varied the components are. A higher score indicates more diversity (mixing 0s, 1s, and 2s).

3. **Tunable Parameters**: The function uses tunable parameters to adjust the weight of balance and diversity in the final score. This allows users to prioritize either balanced vectors or diverse vectors by modifying these weights.

4. **Combined Score**: The final score is a weighted sum of the balance and diversity scores, providing a heuristic for selecting vectors that are likely to contribute to a larger cap set.

This approach ensures that the algorithm first selects vectors that are balanced and diverse, which are more likely to contribute to a larger cap set without forming forbidden arithmetic progressions. The tunable parameters provide flexibility for users to adjust the algorithm's behavior based on specific needs or constraints.

Key innovations:

1. **Multi-component scoring** combining:
   - Symbol diversity (balanced 0/1/2 counts)
   - Axis balance (avoiding concentration in specific dimensions)
   - Spatial distribution (filling gaps in existing set)
   - Interaction terms (pairwise coordinate relationships)

2. **Tunable parameters** for:
   - Component weightings
   - Spatial distribution tradeoffs (centrality vs spread)
   - Special pattern bonuses

3. **Practical heuristics** that:
   - Reward vectors that maintain cap set properties
   - Consider both individual coordinates and their interactions
   - Balance between global and local distribution

The function maintains reasonable computational complexity while introducing more sophisticated selection criteria than simple symbol counting. The tunable parameters allow optimization for specific cap set construction scenarios.

Key innovations:

1. **Dimension Balance Score**: Measures how evenly values are distributed across all 8 dimensions, preventing overrepresentation in any coordinate.

2. **Middle Value Preference**: Explicitly favors vectors with more 1s since they offer more combinatorial possibilities in cap sets.

3. **Combinatorial Potential**: Estimates how many valid triplets a vector could participate in (proxy for future flexibility).

4. **Tunable Parameters**:
   - Weights for different score components
   - Special case adjustments (uniform vectors, arithmetic properties)
   - Individual heuristic strengths

5. **Special Cases Handling**: Additional scoring rules for vectors with special properties that might affect cap set construction.

The function combines multiple heuristics that have theoretical justification for cap set construction while exposing the most important parameters for tuning. The weights and adjustments can be optimized for specific construction scenarios.

-- [256.0] -- GPT-4o-mini ----sample--------
To implement an improved vector priority strategy for constructing 8-dimensional cap sets, we'll focus on a few heuristics that can help prioritize the selection of vectors. Here, I'll demonstrate a new priority function that considers both diversity and balance among the dimensions of the chosen vectors.

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Vector Diversity**: We want to encourage diversity in the chosen vectors; that is, we don't want to select too many vectors that are similar or have components concentrated in a certain value.
2. **Dimensional Balance**: We can look at how evenly distributed the values (0, 1, 2) are across all dimensions.
3. **Tunable Parameters**: We will include parameters to adjust the weights of diversity and dimensional balance, allowing for flexible tuning.

### The New Priority Function

Below is the improved version of the priority function `priority_v1`:

```python
import numpy as np
import itertools
from typing import List, Tuple

def tunable(options):
    # Placeholder for the tunable function
    return options[0]

def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...]) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0` focusing on diversity and dimensional balance."""

    def calculate_diversity(vector: tuple[int, ...]) -> float:
        """Calculate the diversity score of the vector."""
        unique_values = len(set(vector))
        return unique_values  # Higher is better

    def calculate_balance(vector: tuple[int, ...]) -> float:
        """Calculate the balance score of the vector across its components."""
        counts = np.bincount(vector, minlength=3)  # Since values are in {0, 1, 2}
        total = sum(counts)
        balance = sum((count / total) ** 2 for count in counts if total > 0)
        return -balance  # We want to minimize concentration, so return negative balance
    
    # Tunable parameters
    diversity_weight = tunable([0.5, 0.7, 1.0])
    balance_weight = tunable([0.3, 0.5, 0.8])

    diversity_score = calculate_diversity(el)
    balance_score = calculate_balance(el)

    # Combine scores with weights
    score = (diversity_weight * diversity_score) + (balance_weight * balance_score)

    return score

# Example usage of priority_v1
element = (0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2)
print(priority_v1(element))
```

### Explanation

1. **Diversity Calculation**: The `calculate_diversity` function computes how many unique values are present in the vector, which promotes diversity.
2. **Balance Calculation**: The `calculate_balance` function looks at how the values are distributed across the three possible values (0, 1, 2) and penalizes concentration.
3. **Combining Scores**: The final score is computed by combining the diversity and balance scores, adjusted by tunable parameters. This allows for flexibility in how much importance is given to each component.

This function can serve as a foundational part of a greedy algorithm to construct cap sets, using the prioritized elements as input. The tunable parameters also provide a good basis for experimentation and optimization.

### Explanation:

1. **Tunable Parameters**:
   - `axis_balance_weight`: Controls the importance of balancing components across the vector. A higher weight means vectors with more balanced components (e.g., equal numbers of 0s, 1s, and 2s) are prioritized.
   - `diversity_weight`: Controls the importance of having diverse components. A higher weight means vectors with more varied components (e.g., a mix of 0s, 1s, and 2s) are prioritized.

2. **Balance Score**:
   - Measures how evenly the components are distributed. A lower variance indicates a more balanced vector.

3. **Diversity Score**:
   - Measures how varied the components are. A higher score indicates a more diverse vector.

4. **Risk Score**:
   - Heuristic to estimate the likelihood of forming a line with existing vectors. Vectors that share components with existing vectors are considered less safe and thus have a higher risk score.

5. **Total Priority**:
   - A weighted sum of the balance, diversity, and risk scores. Higher values indicate the vector should be considered earlier in the greedy algorithm.

This strategy aims to balance between selecting vectors that are diverse and balanced while minimizing the risk of forming lines with existing vectors. The tunable parameters allow for experimentation with different priorities, making the algorithm flexible and adaptable.

### Explanation:

1. **Tunable Parameters**: The function uses tunable parameters to adjust the importance of different scoring factors. The parameters are applied to four key aspects:
   - **Balance**: Ensures vectors with a more even distribution of 0s, 1s, and 2s are preferred.
   - **Diversity**: Encourages selection of vectors that differ from existing ones in many positions.
   - **Conflict Risk**: Estimates the likelihood of forming an arithmetic progression with existing vectors.
   - **Symmetry**: Penalizes vectors with repetitive or symmetric patterns that might cause issues.

2. **Scoring Factors**:
   - **Balance Score**: Calculates how evenly the digits are distributed in the vector.
   - **Diversity Score**: Measures how different the vector is from others in the set.
   - **Conflict Risk Score**: Approximates the risk of completing an arithmetic progression with existing vectors.
   - **Symmetry Score**: Evaluates the uniqueness of the vector's pattern.

3. **Combination**: The final priority is a weighted sum of these scores, allowing users to adjust the influence of each factor through the tunable parameters.

This approach balances exploration (diversity and balance) with exploitation (minimizing conflict risks), making it effective for constructing large cap sets in 8 dimensions.

```

### Explanation of Heuristics:

1. **Axis Balance**:
   - **Objective**: Favor vectors that have a balanced distribution of values across all dimensions.
   - **Implementation**: Calculates the standard deviation of the counts of each value (0, 1, 2) in the vector. A lower standard deviation indicates a more balanced distribution, so we use the negative of the standard deviation to prioritize such vectors.

2. **Diversity**:
   - **Objective**: Favor vectors with a higher number of unique values.
   - **Implementation**: Counts the number of unique values in the vector and returns this count multiplied by a weight to prioritize vectors with more diversity.

3. **Centrality**:
   - **Objective**: Favor vectors whose values are closer to the mean.
   - **Implementation**: Calculates the mean value of the vector components and returns this mean multiplied by a weight. Vectors with values closer to the mean are generally more central in the hypercube.

4. **Sparsity**:
   - **Objective**: Favor vectors with fewer zeros, as they might help avoid lines more effectively.
   - **Implementation**: Counts the number of zeros in the vector and returns this count multiplied by a weight. Fewer zeros can make the vector less sparse and potentially more useful in avoiding lines.

### Tunable Parameters:

- `axis_balance_weight`: Adjusts the importance of the axis balance heuristic.
- `diversity_weight`: Adjusts the importance of the diversity heuristic.
- `centrality_weight`: Adjusts the importance of the centrality heuristic.
- `sparsity_weight`: Adjusts the importance of the sparsity heuristic.

These parameters can be tuned to optimize the performance of the cap set construction algorithm for specific use cases or datasets.

### Usage Example:

To use this function in a greedy algorithm for constructing an 8-dimensional cap set, you would sort the candidate vectors based on their priority scores:

```python
# Generate all possible 8-dimensional vectors with components in {0, 1, 2}
all_elements = list(itertools.product([0, 1, 2], repeat=8))

# Sort elements by priority score
sorted_elements = sorted(all_elements, key=priority_v1, reverse=True)

# Select the top k elements to form the cap set
cap_set = sorted_elements[:k]
```

This approach provides a more informed and flexible way to select vectors for the cap set, improving the quality of the resulting set.

-- [256.0] -- Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct ----sample--------
Certainly! Let's design an improved function `priority_v1` that uses a more sophisticated vector selection strategy for constructing 8-dimensional cap sets. We will focus on creating a heuristic that prioritizes vectors based on their diversity and centrality within the set. We will also introduce some tunable parameters to allow for flexibility in the selection process.

### Improved Vector Priority Strategy

1. **Diversity**: Vectors that have a more diverse distribution of components (0, 1, 2) across different dimensions are given higher priority. This ensures that the cap set is well-distributed and covers more of the space.

2. **Centrality**: Vectors that are closer to the "center" of the 8-dimensional space (i.e., vectors with more components equal to 1) are given higher priority. This helps in maintaining a balanced distribution around the center.

3. **Axis Balance**: Vectors that balance the number of components in each dimension (i.e., avoid having too many 0s or 2s in any single dimension) are given higher priority. This ensures that no dimension is overloaded with a particular value.

### Tunable Parameters

- `diversity_weight`: The weight assigned to the diversity metric.
- `centrality_weight`: The weight assigned to the centrality metric.
- `axis_balance_weight`: The weight assigned to the axis balance metric.

### Implementation

```python
import numpy as np
import itertools
from typing import List, Tuple

def tunable(options: List[float]) -> float:
    # Placeholder for the tunable parameter selection mechanism
    # In practice, this would be replaced by a mechanism to select one of the options
    return options[0]  # For demonstration, always return the first option

    """Improved version of `priority_v0`.

    Args:
        el: An 8-dimensional vector (tuple) with components in {0, 1, 2}.

    def calculate_centrality(vector: Tuple[int, ...]) -> float:
        """Calculate the centrality of the vector."""
        return sum(1 for v in vector if v == 1) / n

    def calculate_axis_balance(vector: Tuple[int, ...]) -> float:
        """Calculate the axis balance of the vector."""
        counts = np.bincount(vector, minlength=3)
        max_count = max(counts)
        min_count = min(counts)
        return 1 - (max_count - min_count) / n

    # Tunable parameters
    diversity_weight = tunable([0.1, 0.3, 0.5])
    centrality_weight = tunable([0.2, 0.4, 0.6])
    axis_balance_weight = tunable([0.1, 0.3, 0.5])

    # Calculate the priority score
    diversity_score = calculate_diversity(el)
    centrality_score = calculate_centrality(el)
    axis_balance_score = calculate_axis_balance(el)

    priority_score = (
        diversity_weight * diversity_score +
        centrality_weight * centrality_score +
        axis_balance_weight * axis_balance_score
    )

    return priority_score
```

### Explanation

1. **Diversity Calculation**:
   - We count the number of unique values in the vector and normalize it by the dimension size `n`.
   - A vector with more unique values (i.e., a mix of 0, 1, and 2) will have a higher diversity score.

2. **Centrality Calculation**:
   - We count the number of components that are equal to 1 and normalize it by the dimension size `n`.
   - Vectors with more components equal to 1 are considered more central.

3. **Axis Balance Calculation**:
   - We count the occurrences of each value (0, 1, 2) in the vector and calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum counts.
   - We normalize this difference by the dimension size `n` and subtract it from 1 to get a score where 1 indicates perfect balance and 0 indicates imbalance.

4. **Priority Score**:
   - The final priority score is a weighted sum of the diversity, centrality, and axis balance scores.
   - The weights are provided as tunable parameters, allowing for adjustments based on specific needs or performance metrics.

This approach ensures that the vectors are selected based on a combination of their diversity, centrality, and axis balance, which can help in constructing a more robust and well-distributed cap set.

Key innovations:

1. **Multiple diversity measures**:
   - Component diversity (unique values)
   - Positional diversity (value changes between positions)
   - Pattern diversity (unique triplets)

2. **Configurable ideal vector**:
   - Can tune what's considered the "center" vector

3. **Positional weighting**:
   - Different dimensions can be weighted differently

4. **Future-ready distribution scoring**:
   - Placeholder for maintaining overall set balance (would need cap set access)

5. **Clear tuning points**:
   - Diversity measure selection
   - Ideal vector configuration
   - Positional weighting schemes
   - Feature weight distributions

The function maintains practical implementation while offering multiple tuning points for optimization. The tunable parameters are clearly marked and cover both algorithmic choices (which diversity measure to use) and numeric weights.

Key innovations:

1. **Axial Balance**: Measures distribution across each coordinate axis separately, not just overall component counts.

2. **Collision Potential**: Estimates how many future vectors would be blocked by selecting this one, preferring vectors that leave more options open.

3. **Symmetry Breaking**: Actively prefers vectors that break potential symmetries in the growing cap set.

4. **Component Weighting**: Allows different dimensions to have different importance weights, with tunable profiles.

5. **Tunable Parameters**: Clearly marked tuning points for:
   - Relative weights of different heuristics
   - Component weighting schemes
   - Symmetry vs balance tradeoffs

The function maintains practical efficiency (O(n) operations) while introducing more sophisticated selection criteria than simple component diversity. The tunable parameters allow optimization for different stages of cap set construction.

### Explanation:
1. **Component Diversity**: Measures the number of unique components in the vector. A higher score is better, indicating more diverse components.
2. **Component Balance**: Measures the evenness of the distribution of components. A score closer to 1 indicates more balanced distribution.
3. **Centrality**: Measures how close the vector is to the center vector (all components are 1). A lower distance from the center is better.
4. **Connectivity**: Measures how well the vector connects to other vectors already in the cap set. Specifically, it counts the number of vectors in the set that differ by only one component and normalizes this count by the size of the existing set. A higher score indicates better connectivity.

### Tunable Parameters:
- `diversity_weight`: Weight for the component diversity score.
- `balance_weight`: Weight for the component balance score.
- `centrality_weight`: Weight for the centrality score.
- `connectivity_weight`: Weight for the connectivity score.

These weights can be adjusted to prioritize different aspects of the vector selection process, making the function flexible and adaptable to various scenarios.

### Explanation:
1. **Centrality**: It measures how close the vector is to the ideal center `(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)`. A higher score indicates proximity to this center.

2. **Variance**: It uses the variance of the counts of each component in the vector, encouraging uniformity across the dimensions.

3. **Balance**: A balance score is calculated that encourages evenly distributed values across the 8 dimensions.

4. **Tunable Weights**: Each priority aspect (centrality, variance, and balance) has a corresponding weight that can be adjusted dynamically using `tunable`, allowing for flexibility and experimentation in tuning the algorithm.

This function is designed to not only maintain the efficiency of vector selection but also enhance the quality and diversity of selected vectors in the 8-dimensional space.

To solve this problem, we need to construct an 8-dimensional cap set using a greedy algorithm with an improved priority function. The goal is to select vectors that are less likely to form arithmetic progressions, thus maximizing the size of the cap set.

### Approach
The priority function `priority_v1` assigns a score to each vector based on three key heuristics:
1. **Digit Diversity**: Vectors with a more balanced distribution of digits (0, 1, 2) are preferred. This is measured using the Gini index, which is higher for more diverse distributions.
2. **Distance from the Center**: Vectors closer to the center (i.e., with more 1s) are preferred because they can combine with a wider range of other vectors without forming lines.
3. **Spread**: Vectors with more unique digits are preferred as they offer more flexibility in combining with other vectors.

Each of these heuristics is weighted using tunable parameters to allow for adjustment based on experimental results.

### Solution Code
```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...]) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0` with tunable parameters."""
    c0 = el.count(0)
    c1 = el.count(1)
    c2 = el.count(2)
    total = len(el)
    
    # Digit diversity (Gini index)
    p0 = c0 / total
    p1 = c1 / total
    p2 = c2 / total
    gini = 1 - (p0**2 + p1**2 + p2**2)
    
    # Distance from center (number of 1s)
    distance_score = c1 / total
    
    # Spread (number of unique digits)
    spread = len(set(el))
    spread_score = spread / 3  # Normalized to [0, 1]
    
    # Weights for tuning
    gini_weight = tunable([0.5, 0.6, 0.7])
    distance_weight = tunable([0.3, 0.4, 0.5])
    spread_weight = tunable([0.2, 0.3, 0.4])
    
    # Calculate the priority as a weighted sum
    priority = (
        gini_weight * gini +
        distance_weight * distance_score +
        spread_weight * spread_score
    )
    
    return priority
```

### Explanation
1. **Digit Diversity (Gini Index)**: The Gini index is calculated to measure the balance of digit distribution in the vector. A higher Gini index indicates a more diverse distribution of digits, which is beneficial for avoiding arithmetic progressions.
2. **Distance from the Center**: The score is based on the number of 1s in the vector. Vectors with more 1s are closer to the center and are preferred as they can combine with a wider range of other vectors.
3. **Spread**: The number of unique digits in the vector is counted and normalized. A higher spread indicates a more versatile vector that can combine with others in more ways.

The priority function combines these three scores using tunable weights, allowing for flexibility in adjusting the importance of each heuristic. This approach ensures that the selected vectors are more likely to contribute to a larger cap set without forming arithmetic progressions.

-- [306.0, 353.0] -- Deepseek-R1-distill-qwen-7b ----sample--------


To create an improved version of the priority function for constructing 8-dimensional cap sets, we'll introduce a more sophisticated scoring system that incorporates multiple heuristics and tunable parameters. The goal is to select vectors that enhance diversity, balance across dimensions, and avoid arithmetic progressions.

### Approach

1. **Helper Functions**:
   - **Evenness**: Measures how evenly the elements are distributed across the values 0, 1, and 2. Higher evenness is better.
   - **Dimensional Spread**: Evaluates how many unique values the vector contains. More spread out vectors are preferable.
   - **Energy**: Represents the sum of the squares of the vector elements, favoring vectors with higher variability.

2. **Tunable Parameters**: Introduce adjustable weights for the new metrics to allow fine-tuning the selection process. These weights can be adjusted based on the specific requirements or characteristics of the cap set construction.

3. **Combined Score**: Merge the scores from the new metrics with the existing ones using tunable weights to determine the priority of each vector.

### Solution Code

import numpy as np

def priority_v3(el: tuple[int, ...]) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v2` with novel vector selection strategy.
    
    Args:

        return entropy  # Higher is better

        spread = (unique_count - 1) / (max_unique - 1)
        return spread  # Higher is better
    
    # Helper function to calculate the energy of the vector
    def calculate_energy(vector: tuple[int, ...]) -> float:
        energy = np.sum(vector ** 2)
        return energy  # Higher is better

        # Tunable parameters
        evenness_weight = 0.4  # Can be adjusted between 0 and 1
        spread_weight = 0.5    # Can be adjusted between 0 and 1
        energy_weight = 0.1    # Can be adjusted between 0 and 1
        
        return (evenness * evenness_weight) + (spread * spread_weight) + (energy * energy_weight)
    
    return final_priority(el)
```

### Explanation

1. **Evenness Calculation**: This metric ensures that the vector elements are distributed as evenly as possible across 0, 1, and 2. A higher entropy value indicates a more balanced distribution.

2. **Dimensional Spread**: This metric evaluates how many unique values are present in the vector. A higher spread is desirable as it reduces the chance of forming arithmetic progressions.

3. **Energy Calculation**: This metric favors vectors with elements that have higher variability, promoting a more diverse set of vectors.

4. **Tunable Weights**: The weights for evenness, spread, and energy can be adjusted to prioritize different aspects of the vector selection. This flexibility allows the algorithm to be fine-tuned for specific needs or characteristics of the cap set construction.

By integrating these metrics and tunable parameters, the priority_v3 function provides a more comprehensive and adaptable approach to selecting vectors for constructing 8-dimensional cap sets.

### Explanation of Novel Heuristics

1. **Smoothness**: This measures how smooth the transitions between adjacent components of the vector are. Vectors with smaller differences between adjacent components are considered more "well-behaved" and thus have a higher priority. The weight for this heuristic can be tuned to influence its importance.

2. **Novelty**: This measures how unique or novel the pattern of the vector is. For example, vectors with less common sequences of differences between adjacent components are given a higher priority. This helps in avoiding redundant patterns and promotes diversity in the cap set.

### Tunable Parameters

- `axis_balance_weight`: Weight for the axis balance heuristic.
- `diversity_weight`: Weight for the diversity heuristic.
- `centrality_weight`: Weight for the centrality heuristic.
- `sparsity_weight`: Weight for the sparsity heuristic.
- `smoothness_weight`: Weight for the smoothness heuristic.
- `novelty_weight`: Weight for the novelty heuristic.

Each parameter is wrapped in a `tunable` function to mark it as adjustable. This allows for easy experimentation with different weights to optimize the cap set construction.

### Practical Use

To use this function in a greedy algorithm for constructing cap sets, you would typically sort a list of candidate vectors by their priority score and select them in descending order. Here's an example of how you might do that:

```python
candidates = list(itertools.product([0, 1, 2], repeat=8))
candidates.sort(key=priority_v2, reverse=True)

cap_set = []
for candidate in candidates:
    if is_valid_addition(cap_set, candidate):  # Define your own function to check validity
        cap_set.append(candidate)

print(cap_set)
```

In this example, `is_valid_addition` is a placeholder function that you would define to check whether adding a new vector to the cap set maintains the desired properties (e.g., no three vectors form a line).

Certainly! Here's an improved Python function for constructing 8-dimensional cap sets with a novel vector priority strategy and parameter tuning points marked using the `tunable()` wrapper.

### Improved Vector Selection Strategy

The new strategy will consider the following aspects:
1. **Component Diversity**: How varied are the components? (Higher is better)
2. **Component Balance**: How evenly distributed are the components? (Near equal counts for each value is considered best)
3. **Centrality**: How close is the vector to the 'center' (all 1s)? (Lower 'distance' from center is better)
4. **Axis Balance**: How well-balanced is the vector across all axes? (Equal distribution along each axis is considered best)

Each aspect will have a tunable weight to allow for fine-tuning of the selection process.

### Implementation

import numpy as np
from typing import List, Tuple

def priority_v2(el: tuple[int, ...]) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v1`."""
    
    n = 8

        distance = sum(abs(el[i] - center[i]) for i in range(n))
        return 1 - (distance / (2 * n))  # Normalize to a 0-1 scale

    def axis_balance(el: tuple[int, ...]) -> float:
        """Measures how well-balanced the vector is across all axes. Equal distribution along each axis is considered best."""
        axis_counts = [np.bincount(np.array(el)[axis::3], minlength=3) for axis in range(3)]
        axis_scores = [1 - np.sum(((counts / np.sum(counts)) - (1/3)) ** 2) for counts in axis_counts]
        return np.mean(axis_scores)

    # Tunable weights for different priority aspects
    diversity_weight = tunable([0.3, 0.4, 0.5])
    balance_weight = tunable([0.3, 0.4, 0.5])
    centrality_weight = tunable([0.2, 0.3, 0.4])
    axis_balance_weight = tunable([0.2, 0.3, 0.4])

    # Calculate the overall priority score
    priority = (
        diversity_weight * component_diversity(el)
        + balance_weight * component_balance(el)
        + centrality_weight * centrality(el)
        + axis_balance_weight * axis_balance(el)
    )
    
    return priority
```

### Explanation

1. **Component Diversity**: This measures the number of unique components in the vector. A vector with more unique components is considered more diverse.
2. **Component Balance**: This measures how evenly distributed the components are. It uses a normalized distribution and compares it to a uniform distribution.
3. **Centrality**: This measures the distance of the vector from the 'center' vector (all 1s). Vectors closer to the center are given higher priority.
4. **Axis Balance**: This measures the balance of the vector across all axes. It checks the distribution of components in every third position (i.e., positions 0, 3, 6; 1, 4, 7; and 2, 5, 0) and calculates the balance score for each axis.

### Tuning Parameters

The weights for each aspect (`diversity_weight`, `balance_weight`, `centrality_weight`, and `axis_balance_weight`) are wrapped in `tunable()` to allow for easy adjustment and experimentation. These weights determine the importance of each aspect in the overall priority calculation.

### Usage

To use this function in a greedy algorithm for constructing cap sets, you can sort the vectors based on their priority scores:

```python
# Example usage
vectors = list(itertools.product([0, 1, 2], repeat=8))
vectors.sort(key=priority_v2, reverse=True)
cap_set = []

for vector in vectors:
    if is_valid_cap_vector(vector, cap_set):
        cap_set.append(vector)

def is_valid_cap_vector(vector: Tuple[int, ...], cap_set: List[Tuple[int, ...]]) -> bool:
    """Check if adding `vector` to `cap_set` forms a cap set."""
    for v1 in cap_set:
        for v2 in cap_set:
            if v1 != v2:
                v3 = tuple((vector[i] + v1[i] + v2[i]) % 3 for i in range(8))
                if v3 in cap_set:
                    return False
    return True
```

In this example, `is_valid_cap_vector` checks if adding a new vector to the cap set would form a line (which is not allowed in a cap set). The vectors are sorted by their priority scores, and the highest-priority vectors are added to the cap set first.

### Notes

- The `tunable()` function is a placeholder and should be replaced with actual tuning mechanisms or manual adjustments as needed.
- The `axis_balance` function ensures that the vector is balanced not just globally but also locally across specific axes, which can help in constructing a more robust cap set.
- The weights can be adjusted based on empirical testing to find the optimal combination for your specific use case.

Create an improved Python function for constructing 8-dimensional cap sets that demonstrates:
Novel vector priority strategy: Design a smarter vector selection strategy.
Parameter tuning points: Mark adjustable parameters using tunable([option1, option2, ...]) wrapper. Examples:
`if axis_balance_weight = tunable([0.1, 0.3, 0.5])`
`sorted(elements, key=lambda x: tunable([x.diversity, x.centrality]))`
Focus first on innovative vector selection heuristics, then expose tuning parameters via `tunable()`. Keep implementation practical but non-trivial. 

Note:
1. Do not generate the `tunable()` function implementation.
2. Any helper functions should be defined within the priority function.

Certainly! Below is an improved version of the `priority_v2` function that introduces a novel vector selection strategy and exposes tuning parameters using the `tunable()` wrapper. The strategy focuses on combining multiple heuristics, such as diversity, balance, and a new heuristic called "spread," which measures how evenly the values are distributed across the dimensions.

### Explanation of Heuristics and Tuning Parameters

1. **Component Diversity**:
   - Measures the variety of the components in the vector. A vector with all unique components will have a higher diversity score.
   - Normalized by dividing the number of unique components by the dimension `n`.

2. **Component Balance**:
   - Measures how equally the values {0, 1, 2} are distributed across the vector.
   - Uses the normalized distribution of values and calculates the squared difference from a uniform distribution.

3. **Centrality**:
   - Measures how close the vector is to the center, which is the vector with all components equal to 1.
   - Calculates the Manhattan distance from the center and normalizes it.

4. **Spread**:
   - Measures how evenly distributed the values are across the dimensions. A vector where the counts of {0, 1, 2} are as close to each other as possible will have a higher spread score.
   - Normalizes the difference between the maximum and minimum counts of the values.

### Tunable Parameters

- `diversity_weight`: Weight for the diversity score.
- `balance_weight`: Weight for the balance score.
- `centrality_weight`: Weight for the centrality score.
- `spread_weight`: Weight for the spread score.

These weights can be adjusted to fine-tune the selection criteria according to the specific requirements or experimental results. The `tunable()` wrapper is used to indicate that these parameters are adjustable.

Key improvements in this version:

   - Multi-axis balance calculation
   - Pattern diversity scoring (transitions and alternations)

2. **Risk Assessment**:
   - Explicit line formation risk calculation
   - Arithmetic progression detection
   - Concentration risk for single values

3. **Novel Heuristics**:
   - Vector symmetry consideration (optional)
   - Centrality measurement using Euclidean distance
   - Pattern-based diversity metrics

4. **Tunable Parameters**:
   - Clearly marked tuning points for all major components
   - Optional features (like symmetry) can be easily enabled/disabled
   - Weight parameters exposed for optimization

5. **Normalization**:
   - All metrics properly normalized to comparable scales
   - Combined score remains balanced across different metrics

The function maintains practical efficiency while introducing more sophisticated selection criteria that should better avoid line formations in the 8-dimensional cap set construction.

### Explanation:

1. **Dimension Balance Score**: This score measures how evenly the values 0, 1, and 2 are distributed across all dimensions. A higher score indicates a more balanced distribution. The weight for this score is tunable.

2. **Middle Value Preference**: This score rewards vectors with more middle values (1s), as they generally have higher combinatorial potential. The weight for this score is tunable.

3. **Combinatorial Potential**: This score estimates how many valid triplets the vector could participate in. Vectors with more balanced value proportions have higher potential. The weight for this score is tunable.

4. **Diversity Score**: This score measures the diversity of the vector components. Vectors with more unique values are favored. The weight for this score is tunable.

5. **Risk Score**: This score estimates the risk of forming a line with existing vectors. Vectors with more repeated values are penalized. The weight for this score is tunable and negative to indicate penalty.

6. **Tunable Parameters**: The function uses a `tunable()` wrapper to mark parameters that can be adjusted for optimization. These include weights for balance, middle value preference, combinatorial potential, diversity, and risk, as well as penalties for uniform vectors and a slight favor for vectors with a special arithmetic property.

### Notes:
- The `tunable()` function is a placeholder and should be replaced with an actual tuning mechanism in a real-world application.
- The function combines the scores using a weighted sum, where the weights are marked as tunable.
- The additional adjustments for uniform vectors and vectors with a special arithmetic property are also marked as tunable.

-- [303.0, 338.0] -- DeepSeek-R1-distill-qwen-32b ----sample--------


To create an improved function for constructing 8-dimensional cap sets, we focus on designing a smarter vector selection strategy with tunable parameters. The priority function considers several metrics to evaluate each vector's desirability, combining them with adjustable weights to optimize the selection process.

### Approach
The approach involves defining a priority function that evaluates each vector based on multiple metrics, each contributing to the overall priority score. The metrics include:

1. **Entropy**: Measures the diversity of the vector's values, favoring vectors with a balanced distribution of 0s, 1s, and 2s.
2. **Unique Coordinate Count**: Rewards vectors where each coordinate has a unique value, promoting diversity across dimensions.
3. **Modular Sum**: Prefers vectors whose sum modulo 3 is not zero, aiming to avoid configurations that may form lines.
4. **Interaction Terms**: Encourages vectors with diverse pairwise relationships between coordinates, reducing the likelihood of forming lines.

Each metric is assigned a tunable weight, allowing for experimentation with different configurations to find the optimal strategy.

        total = sum(values)
        if total == 0:
            return 0.0

                    count += 1
        return count / (n * (n - 1) / 2)

    return priority
```

### Explanation
The `priority_v2` function evaluates each vector based on four key metrics:

1. **Entropy**: Computes the entropy of the vector's values to measure diversity, favoring vectors with a balanced distribution of 0s, 1s, and 2s.
2. **Unique Coordinate Count**: Counts how many coordinates have unique values, promoting diversity across dimensions.
3. **Modular Sum**: Prefers vectors whose sum modulo 3 is not zero, aiming to avoid configurations that may form lines.
4. **Interaction Terms**: Encourages vectors with diverse pairwise relationships between coordinates, reducing the likelihood of forming lines.

Each metric is assigned a tunable weight, allowing for experimentation with different configurations. The function combines these metrics into a priority score, with additional bonuses for vectors that meet specific criteria, such as having all unique coordinates or a modular sum of 1. This approach provides a flexible and tunable strategy for selecting vectors in the cap set construction process.

Create an improved Python function for constructing 8-dimensional cap sets that demonstrates:
Novel vector priority strategy: Design a smarter vector selection strategy.
Parameter tuning points: Mark adjustable parameters using tunable([option1, option2, ...]) wrapper. Examples:
`if axis_balance_weight = tunable([0.1, 0.3, 0.5])`
`sorted(elements, key=lambda x: tunable([x.diversity, x.centrality]))`
Focus first on innovative vector selection heuristics, then expose tuning parameters via `tunable()`. Keep implementation practical but non-trivial. 

Note:
1. Do not generate the `tunable()` function implementation.
2. Any helper functions should be defined within the priority function.

Certainly! Let's design an improved vector selection strategy for constructing 8-dimensional cap sets. We'll focus on the following heuristics:

1. **Diversity Across Components**: Encourage vectors with a mix of 0s, 1s, and 2s.
2. **Balance Within Dimensions**: Ensure no dimension is overly dominated by a single value.
3. **Centrality**: Favor vectors that are closer to the center (all 1s).
4. **Arithmetic Potential**: Reward vectors that are less likely to form invalid triplets with existing vectors.
5. **Unique Dimensional Values**: Encourage vectors that introduce new unique values in underrepresented dimensions.

We'll use tunable parameters to adjust the importance of each heuristic. Here's the implementation:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Callable

### Explanation:
1. **Component Diversity**: Rewards vectors with a mix of 0s, 1s, and 2s.
2. **Dimension Balance**: Ensures no single value dominates any dimension.
3. **Centrality**: Favors vectors close to the center (all 1s).
4. **Arithmetic Potential**: Penalizes vectors that are likely to form invalid triplets with the existing set.
5. **Unique Dimensional Values**: Rewards vectors that introduce new values in underrepresented dimensions.

### Tunable Parameters:
- `diversity_weight`: Adjusts the importance of component diversity.
- `balance_weight`: Adjusts the importance of dimension balance.
- `centrality_weight`: Adjusts the importance of centrality.
- `arithmetic_weight`: Adjusts the importance of avoiding invalid triplets.
- `unique_value_weight`: Adjusts the importance of introducing new unique values.

### Additional Adjustments:
- **Uniform Vectors**: Penalized by a tunable factor.
- **Special Arithmetic Property**: Adjusted by a tunable factor based on the sum modulo 3.

This function is designed to be flexible and allow for fine-tuning of the heuristics to optimize the cap set construction process.

Create an improved Python function for constructing 8-dimensional cap sets that demonstrates:
Novel vector priority strategy: Design a smarter vector selection strategy.
Parameter tuning points: Mark adjustable parameters using tunable([option1, option2, ...]) wrapper. Examples:
`if axis_balance_weight = tunable([0.1, 0.3, 0.5])`
`sorted(elements, key=lambda x: tunable([x.diversity, x.centrality]))`
Focus first on innovative vector selection heuristics, then expose tuning parameters via `tunable()`. Keep implementation practical but non-trivial. 

Note:
1. Do not generate the `tunable()` function implementation.
2. Any helper functions should be defined within the priority function.

### Changes and Innovations:
1. **Incorporation of Centrality:** The function emphasizes proximity to the center `(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)` as an important metric for prioritizing vectors.

2. **Variance and Balance:** It computes the variance of the vector's components and balance between the different component counts, utilizing these metrics in vector selection.

3. **Risk Assessment:** A risk score is calculated based on the likelihood of forming collinear vectors, which allows for better management of potential conflicts in constructing the cap sets.

4. **Tunable Parameters:** The weights for centrality, variance, balance, and risk are now exposed as tunable parameters, making it possible to customize the selection algorithm for different scenarios.

This approach creates a more dynamic and effective priority ranking for vectors when constructing 8-dimensional cap sets.

Novel vector priority strategy: Design a smarter vector selection strategy.
Parameter tuning points: Mark adjustable parameters using tunable([option1, option2, ...]) wrapper. Examples:

Key innovations:

1. **Pattern Analysis**: Scores vectors based on rarity of adjacent value patterns, promoting diversity in local structures.

2. **Line Risk Assessment**: Estimates potential to form lines with existing vectors by examining value repetitions across dimensions.

3. **Future Collision Prediction**: Measures how many future vectors would be excluded by adding this one, favoring choices that leave more options open.

4. **Dimension Balance**: Uses an entropy-like measure to encourage even distribution of values across all dimensions.

The function exposes four tunable parameters controlling the weights of these factors. The implementation remains practical while incorporating non-trivial heuristics that consider both immediate and future implications of vector selection.

### Key Features of `priority_v2`:
1. **Innovative Heuristics**: The function combines various heuristics including balance, diversity, centrality, sparsity, and line risk into a comprehensive score. This allows for more nuanced vector prioritization based on multiple attributes.
   
2. **Tunable Parameters**: The weights for each calculation are marked as tunable parameters. These parameters can be adjusted depending on the specific requirements of the problem space. This flexibility allows for experimenting with different configurations of metrics to find the optimal heuristic balance.

3. **Normalization and Risk Assessment**: The function computes a risk score that penalizes uniform vectors in terms of possible line formation, which is particularly relevant for cap set problems.

4. **Simplified Interface**: Function signatures and explanations are clear, making the code easy to understand and maintain.

    """Improved version of `priority_v1`."""



Create an improved Python function for constructing 8-dimensional cap sets that demonstrates:
Novel vector priority strategy: Design a smarter vector selection strategy.
Parameter tuning points: Mark adjustable parameters using tunable([option1, option2, ...]) wrapper. Examples:
`if axis_balance_weight = tunable([0.1, 0.3, 0.5])`
`sorted(elements, key=lambda x: tunable([x.diversity, x.centrality]))`
Focus first on innovative vector selection heuristics, then expose tuning parameters via `tunable()`. Keep implementation practical but non-trivial. 

Note:
1. Do not generate the `tunable()` function implementation.
2. Any helper functions should be defined within the priority function.

Here's an improved priority function incorporating novel selection heuristics and tunable parameters:

```python
def priority_v2(el: tuple[int, ...]) -> float:
    """Optimized priority function for 8D cap set construction with tunable parameters."""
    n = 8
    if len(el) != n:
        raise ValueError("Vector must be 8-dimensional.")

    def value_stability(vals: List[int]) -> float:
        """Reward vectors that avoid extreme values in individual coordinates."""
        extreme_count = sum(1 for x in vals if x == 0 or x == 2)
        return 1 - (extreme_count / n)  # Higher for more balanced values

    def coordinate_synergy(vals: List[int]) -> float:
        """Measure of complementary coordinate relationships."""
        synergy = 0
        for i in range(n-1):
            # Reward pairs that can't form arithmetic progressions
            if vals[i] + vals[i+1] not in {0, 2, 4}:
                synergy += 1
        return synergy / (n-1)

    def forbidden_pattern_risk(vals: List[int]) -> float:
        """Heuristic for common line-forming patterns."""
        patterns = {
            'alternating': sum(1 for i in range(n-1) if vals[i] != vals[i+1]),
            'triple': max(sum(1 for x in vals if x == c) for c in {0,1,2})
        }
        # Penalize both uniform and highly alternating patterns
        pattern_risk = (patterns['triple']/n) * (1 - patterns['alternating']/n)
        return 1 - pattern_risk

    # Tunable parameter sets
    component_weights = [
        tunable([0.3, 0.4, 0.5]),  # value_stability
        tunable([0.2, 0.3]),        # coordinate_synergy
        tunable([0.1, 0.15]),       # forbidden_pattern_risk
        tunable([0.05, 0.1])        # diversity_bonus
    ]
    
    # Calculate component scores
    stability = value_stability(el)
    synergy = coordinate_synergy(el)
    pattern_safety = forbidden_pattern_risk(el)
    
    # Dynamic diversity bonus
    unique_values = len(set(el))
    diversity_bonus = tunable([0.5, 0.7, 1.0])[unique_values-1]
    
    # Combine scores with tuned weights
    weighted_sum = (
        component_weights[0] * stability +
        component_weights[1] * synergy +
        component_weights[2] * pattern_safety +
        component_weights[3] * diversity_bonus
    )
    
    # Tunable nonlinear scaling
    return tunable([weighted_sum, weighted_sum**2, np.sqrt(weighted_sum)])
```

Key innovations:

1. **Value Stability** - Prefers vectors with more 1s (neutral values) to reduce line formation potential

2. **Coordinate Synergy** - Rewards adjacent coordinate pairs that resist arithmetic progression formation

3. **Pattern Safety** - Actively penalizes both uniform patterns and high-alternation patterns

4. **Dynamic Diversity Bonus** - Tunable rewards based on number of unique values

Tuning points marked with `tunable()`:
- Component weight combinations
- Diversity bonus levels
- Nonlinear output scaling options
- Multiple parameter sets for different components

This strategy balances immediate pattern avoidance with longer-term set diversity considerations. The parameters allow tuning for different phases of the cap set construction process.

Create an improved Python function for constructing 8-dimensional cap sets that demonstrates:
Novel vector priority strategy: Design a smarter vector selection strategy.

`if axis_balance_weight = tunable([0.1, 0.3, 0.5])`

To address the problem of constructing an 8-dimensional cap set, we need a function that prioritizes vectors based on multiple heuristics to avoid forming lines while promoting diversity and balance. The function `priority_v2` implements an improved strategy by combining several metrics, each with tunable weights, allowing for flexible parameter adjustment.

### Approach
The function `priority_v2` calculates the priority of a vector by considering six key metrics:

1. **Line Risk (LR)**: Measures the likelihood of forming lines with other vectors, based on the number of equal element pairs.
2. **Dimensional Balance (DB)**: Assesses how evenly the elements are distributed across the three possible values (0, 1, 2).
3. **Diversity (D)**: Counts the number of unique elements in the vector.
4. **Centrality (C)**: Determines how close the vector's elements are to the central value (1).
5. **Sparsity (S)**: Counts the number of zeros in the vector.
6. **Pattern Complexity (PC)**: Measures the number of transitions between different elements, indicating a more complex pattern.

Each metric is computed and then combined with tunable weights to produce the total priority score. Higher priority scores indicate that the vector should be considered earlier in the greedy algorithm.

### Solution Code
```python
def priority_v2(el: tuple[int, ...]) -> float:
    """Improved priority function for constructing 8-dimensional cap sets."""
    n = 8
    if len(el) != n:
        raise ValueError("Vector must be 8-dimensional.")

            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if vector[i] == vector[j]:
                    count += 1
        return count

        for i in range(n - 1):
            if vector[i] != vector[i + 1]:
                transitions += 1
        return transitions

    # Calculate each metric
    line_risk = compute_line_risk(el)
    dimensional_balance = compute_dimensional_balance(el)
    diversity = compute_diversity(el)
    centrality = compute_centrality(el)
    sparsity = compute_sparsity(el)
    pattern_complexity = compute_pattern_complexity(el)

    # Tunable parameters
    w_db = tunable([0.1, 0.3, 0.5])  # Weight for dimensional balance
    w_d = tunable([0.2, 0.4, 0.6])   # Weight for diversity
    w_c = tunable([0.15, 0.3, 0.45]) # Weight for centrality
    w_s = tunable([0.05, 0.1, 0.15]) # Weight for sparsity
    w_pc = tunable([0.2, 0.3, 0.4])  # Weight for pattern complexity
    w_lr = tunable([0.05, 0.1, 0.15])# Weight for line risk

    # Combine metrics into total priority
    total_priority = (
        dimensional_balance * w_db +
        diversity * w_d +
        centrality * w_c +
        sparsity * w_s +
        pattern_complexity * w_pc -
        line_risk * w_lr
    )

    return total_priority
```

### Explanation
The function `priority_v2` prioritizes vectors by evaluating six distinct metrics, each contributing to the overall priority score. The metrics are designed to avoid line formations, promote diversity, and encourage balanced and central vectors. The tunable weights allow for flexible adjustment of each metric's importance, making the function adaptable to different strategies for constructing the cap set. This approach ensures a comprehensive and dynamic selection process, aiming to maximize the size of the cap set without forming lines.

To address the problem of constructing an 8-dimensional cap set, we need to develop an improved algorithm that selects vectors in a way that minimizes the formation of arithmetic progressions. The improved algorithm, `priority_v2`, incorporates a novel heuristic to reduce the risk of forming caps, while maintaining tunable parameters for flexibility.

### Approach
The improved algorithm, `priority_v2`, builds upon the previous version by adding a new heuristic to prioritize vectors with lower risk of forming arithmetic progressions (caps). Here's the detailed approach:

1. **Diversity Score**: This score measures the number of unique components in the vector. A higher score indicates a more diverse vector.

2. **Balance Score**: This score measures how evenly the components are distributed across the values 0, 1, and 2. A more balanced distribution is preferred.

3. **Cap Risk Score**: This new heuristic calculates the risk of the vector forming a cap with existing vectors. It does this by checking each dimension to see if the vector's component could be the midpoint of another pair of vectors. The score is higher if the vector has components that could easily form a cap.

4. **Combined Score**: The final priority score is a weighted sum of the diversity, balance, and cap risk scores, allowing users to adjust the importance of each factor using tunable parameters.

```

### Explanation
1. **Diversity Score**: This score is calculated by determining the number of unique values in the vector. A higher score means more diversity, which is beneficial as it reduces the chance of forming a cap.

2. **Balance Score**: This score measures how evenly the values 0, 1, and 2 are distributed. A balanced distribution is preferred as it helps avoid the formation of arithmetic progressions.

3. **Cap Risk Score**: This new heuristic calculates the risk of the vector forming a cap by checking each dimension for potential midpoints with existing vectors. The score is higher if the vector has components that could easily form a cap.

4. **Combined Score**: The final score is a weighted sum of the diversity, balance, and cap risk scores. Users can adjust the weights to prioritize different aspects of vector selection, making the algorithm flexible and adaptable to different strategies for cap set construction.

Key innovations:

1. **Multi-faceted heuristics**:
   - Digit distribution balance (normalized standard deviation)
   - Positional pattern detection (alternating patterns and spatial distribution)
   - Conflict potential estimation (pair variety and center distance)
   - Subspace coverage (entropy across different subspaces)
   - Complementary digit scoring (global distribution balancing)

2. **Tunable parameters**:
   - Individual heuristic weights
   - Subspace selection for coverage analysis
   - Target digit distributions
   - Non-linear score combination options
   - Multiple weighting schemes

3. **Practical considerations**:
   - Uses numpy for efficient vector operations
   - Balanced normalization across different score components
   - Optional non-linear scaling of final score
   - Multiple tuning points for optimization

The function provides numerous tuning points while maintaining clear, interpretable heuristics. The tunable parameters allow for optimization across different construction scenarios while the heuristics themselves capture non-trivial aspects of cap set vector selection.

Parameter tuning points: Mark adjustable parameters using tunable([option1, option2, ...]) wrapper. Examples:

-- [309.0, 342.0] -- Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct ----sample--------
Certainly! Below is an improved Python function for constructing 8-dimensional cap sets with a novel vector priority strategy and tunable parameters. The function incorporates several heuristics to prioritize vectors effectively:

### Heuristics:
1. **Axis Balance**: Ensures a balanced distribution of values across each dimension.
2. **Component Diversity**: Rewards vectors with a diverse set of components (0s, 1s, 2s).
3. **Positional Change**: Measures how often consecutive elements change, promoting variability in adjacent positions.
4. **Pattern Diversity**: Rewards vectors with unique value patterns (e.g., 0-1-2 sequences).
5. **Weighted Centrality**: Measures distance from an ideal reference vector, allowing for configurable centrality.
6. **Set Distribution**: Rewards vectors that help maintain a balanced distribution across the entire cap set (this is a placeholder and would require access to the current cap set).

### Tunable Parameters:
- `axis_balance_weight`: Weight for axis balance heuristic.
- `component_diversity_weight`: Weight for component diversity heuristic.
- `positional_change_weight`: Weight for positional change heuristic.
- `pattern_diversity_weight`: Weight for pattern diversity heuristic.
- `centrality_weight`: Weight for weighted centrality heuristic.
- `distribution_weight`: Weight for set distribution heuristic (currently a placeholder).

### Implementation:

### Explanation:
- **Axis Balance Score**: Measures how evenly the values (0, 1, 2) are distributed across each dimension. It uses an entropy-like measure to ensure that no single value dominates any dimension.
- **Component Diversity Score**: Rewards vectors with a higher number of unique components.
- **Positional Change Score**: Measures the frequency of changes between consecutive elements, promoting variability.
- **Pattern Diversity Score**: Rewards vectors with more unique patterns of three consecutive elements.
- **Weighted Centrality Score**: Measures the distance of the vector from an ideal reference vector, allowing for configurable centrality.
- **Set Distribution Score**: Currently a placeholder that returns a neutral score. In a more complete implementation, it would consider the current cap set to ensure a balanced distribution.

### Tuning Parameters:
- `axis_balance_weight`, `component_diversity_weight`, `positional_change_weight`, `pattern_diversity_weight`, `centrality_weight`, `distribution_weight`: Weights for each heuristic that can be tuned to adjust the priority score.
- `ideal_vector`: The reference vector used for the weighted centrality heuristic.
- `positional_weights`: Weights applied to the distance calculation in the weighted centrality heuristic.

This function provides a flexible and robust way to prioritize vectors in the construction of an 8-dimensional cap set, with clear points for parameter tuning.

Create an improved Python function for constructing 8-dimensional cap sets that demonstrates:
Novel vector priority strategy: Design a smarter vector selection strategy.
Parameter tuning points: Mark adjustable parameters using tunable([option1, option2, ...]) wrapper. Examples:
`if axis_balance_weight = tunable([0.1, 0.3, 0.5])`
`sorted(elements, key=lambda x: tunable([x.diversity, x.centrality]))`
Focus first on innovative vector selection heuristics, then expose tuning parameters via `tunable()`. Keep implementation practical but non-trivial. 

Note:
1. Do not generate the `tunable()` function implementation.
2. Any helper functions should be defined within the priority function.




-- [342.0, 345.0] -- Deepseek-R1-distill-qwen-7b ----sample--------


To create an improved Python function for constructing 8-dimensional cap sets, we'll introduce a smarter vector selection strategy with tunable parameters. The new function, `priority_v1`, incorporates innovative heuristics and adjustable parameters to enhance the selection process.

### Approach
The improved strategy includes:
1. **Entropy-based Diversity**: Encourages vectors with higher entropy, promoting uniform distribution of elements.
2. **Pattern Repetition Penalty**: Penalizes vectors with repetitive sub-patterns to avoid structures that might form arithmetic progressions.
3. **Tunable Parameters**: Allows adjustment of weights for entropy, pattern repetition, and existing heuristics to optimize performance.

### Explanation
The `priority_v1` function introduces two new heuristics:
1. **Entropy Score**: Encourages vectors with elements uniformly distributed across {0, 1, 2}.
2. **Pattern Repetition Penalty**: Penalizes vectors with repetitive sub-patterns to avoid structures that might form arithmetic progressions.

The function includes tunable parameters for the entropy weight and pattern repetition weight, allowing users to adjust their influence during the selection process. This flexibility helps optimize the cap set construction by balancing diversity, balance, and avoiding repetitive structures.

Create an improved Python function for constructing 8-dimensional cap sets that demonstrates:
Novel vector priority strategy: Design a smarter vector selection strategy.
Parameter tuning points: Mark adjustable parameters using tunable([option1, option2, ...]) wrapper. Examples:
`if axis_balance_weight = tunable([0.1, 0.3, 0.5])`
`sorted(elements, key=lambda x: tunable([x.diversity, x.centrality]))`
Focus first on innovative vector selection heuristics, then expose tuning parameters via `tunable()`. Keep implementation practical but non-trivial. 

Note:
1. Do not generate the `tunable()` function implementation.

### Explanation

1. **Function Structure**: The `priority_v2` function is designed to take an 8-dimensional vector and calculate a priority score based on a set of heuristics.

2. **Heuristics for Vector Priority**:
   - **Axis Balance**: Quantifies how balanced the distribution of components is, aiming for a lower standard deviation among counts of the different values.
   - **Diversity**: Measures how many unique elements there are in the vector.
   - **Centrality**: Evaluates how close the mean of the vector is to the central value (1 in this case).
   - **Sparsity**: Counts the number of zeros in the vector, as more zeros could indicate more sparsity.

3. **Tunable Parameters**: Various weights for each heuristic are designed to be adjustable with a `tunable()` wrapper. This allows exploration of different combinations of weighting to fine-tune the priority scores, which is crucial when optimizing the selection strategy for constructing cap sets.

4. **Customizable**: You can modify the values within the `tunable()` lists to experiment with different weights for each heuristic, allowing flexibility for tuning the priorities as necessary.

This implementation provides a comprehensive and practical solution for prioritizing vectors in an 8-dimensional space while exposing important parameters for customization.

                score += 2.0
            if sum(x*y for x,y in enumerate(el)) % 4 == 0:
                score += 1.5
        return score
    
    def forbidden_pattern() -> float:
        """Penalize vectors containing problematic subsequences."""
        penalty = 0
        # Tunable pattern sensitivity
        window_size = tunable([2, 3])
        for i in range(n - window_size + 1):
            segment = el[i:i+window_size]
            if segment in {(0,1,2), (2,1,0), (1,1,1)}:
                penalty += 1.5**window_size
        return -penalty
    
    # Combine scores with tunable weights
    return (
        digit_skew() * tunable([0.7, 1.0, 1.3]) +
        position_entropy() * tunable([0.9, 1.4]) +
        modular_constraint() * tunable([0.5, 1.0]) +
        forbidden_pattern() * tunable([0.8, 1.1])
    )
```

Key innovations:

1. **Digit Skew Control**: Actively penalizes vectors with too many 0s/2s using tunable intensity parameters
2. **Positional Entropy**: Measures value changes between adjacent coordinates with window size tuning
3. **Modular Constraints**: Checks multiple modular conditions (tunable enable/disable)
4. **Pattern Detection**: Penalizes vectors containing arithmetic sequences (0,1,2) or uniform blocks (1,1,1)

Tuning points exposed:
- Relative weights between components
- Intensity of digit skew penalties
- Window sizes for pattern detection
- Enable/disable modular checks
- Sensitivity parameters for forbidden patterns

This implementation combines predictive pattern avoidance with statistical balancing heuristics, while providing multiple tuning knobs for optimization.

To create an improved Python function for constructing 8-dimensional cap sets with a novel priority strategy, we design a function that incorporates multiple heuristics to guide the selection of vectors. The priority is determined based on the vector's balance, distance from the center, spread of digits, and the number of 2s, with tunable weights to adjust the importance of each heuristic.

```python
def priority_v2(el: tuple[int, ...]) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v1` with novel heuristics.
    
    Args:
        el: An 8-dimensional vector (tuple) with components in {0, 1, 2}.

    Returns:
        Priority score determining selection order in greedy algorithm. Higher
        values indicate the vector should be considered earlier.
    """
    c0 = el.count(0)
    c1 = el.count(1)
    c2 = el.count(2)
    total = len(el)
    
    # Balance of counts (higher is better)
    balance_score = 1 - (c0**2 + c1**2 + c2**2) / total
    
    # Distance from center (more 1s is better)
    distance_score = c1 / total
    
    # Spread (more unique digits is better)
    spread_score = len(set(el)) / 3
    
    # Number of 2s (lower is better)
    num_2s_score = c2 / total
    
    # Weights (tunable parameters)
    balance_weight = 0.4
    distance_weight = 0.6
    spread_weight = 0.5
    num_2s_weight = 0.3
    
    # Calculate priority
    priority = (
        balance_score * balance_weight +
        distance_score * distance_weight +
        spread_score * spread_weight -
        num_2s_score * num_2s_weight
    )
    
    return priority
```

This function uses a weighted sum of four heuristics:
1. **Balance of counts**: Higher balance (more uniform distribution of 0s, 1s, and 2s) is preferred.
2. **Distance from center**: More 1s in the vector are preferred as they are closer to the center.
3. **Spread of digits**: More unique digits (0, 1, 2) are preferred for better spread.
4. **Number of 2s**: Fewer 2s are preferred as they are less common in cap sets.

The tunable weights allow adjusting the relative importance of each heuristic, providing flexibility in the selection process.

-- [331.0, 353.0] -- DeepSeek-R1-distill-qwen-32b ----sample--------


To create an improved function for constructing 8-dimensional cap sets, we designed `priority_v2` which employs a novel vector selection strategy. This strategy combines multiple heuristics to prioritize vectors less likely to form arithmetic progressions. The function uses tunable parameters to allow users to adjust the importance of each heuristic.

### Approach
The approach involves calculating several metrics for each vector to determine its priority:
1. **Axis Balance**: Measures how evenly the values 0, 1, and 2 are distributed across dimensions.
2. **Pattern Diversity**: Assesses the variety of transitions between different values in the vector.
3. **Centrality**: Calculates the vector's proximity to the center of the 8-dimensional space.
4. **Line Risk**: Estimates the likelihood of forming arithmetic progressions with other vectors.
5. **Component Entropy**: Quantifies the randomness of the component distribution.
6. **Unique Value Count**: Counts the number of distinct values in the vector.

Each metric is weighted using tunable parameters, allowing users to prioritize certain heuristics over others. The final priority score is a combination of these metrics, with line risk being subtracted to penalize vectors more likely to form lines.

### Explanation
The `priority_v2` function calculates a priority score for each 8-dimensional vector to determine its suitability for inclusion in a cap set. The score is computed by combining several metrics, each weighted by tunable parameters:
- **Axis Balance**: Vectors with more balanced distributions of 0, 1, and 2 across dimensions are prioritized.
- **Pattern Diversity**: Vectors with varied transitions between values are preferred.
- **Centrality**: Vectors closer to the center of the space are favored.
- **Line Risk**: Vectors that are less likely to form arithmetic progressions with others are prioritized.
- **Component Entropy**: Vectors with more diverse component distributions are preferred.
- **Unique Value Count**: Vectors with more unique values are favored.

By adjusting the tunable parameters, users can emphasize different heuristics based on their specific needs, allowing for flexible and optimized cap set construction.

To create an improved function for constructing 8-dimensional cap sets, we'll design a novel vector selection strategy with tunable parameters. The approach combines multiple metrics to evaluate each vector's suitability for inclusion in the cap set, allowing for flexible tuning of the selection criteria.

### Approach
The `priority_v2` function evaluates each vector based on four key metrics:
1. **Component Diversity (Gini Index)**: Measures the diversity of the vector's components.
2. **Centrality**: Indicates how close the vector is to the center (all 1s).
3. **Component Entropy**: Assesses the uniformity of component distribution.
4. **Dimensional Spread**: Counts the dimensions where the component is not 1.

Each metric is calculated and normalized, then combined using tunable weights to produce a priority score. Vectors with higher scores are selected earlier in the greedy algorithm.

### Solution Code
```python
import numpy as np
from typing import Tuple

def priority_v2(el: Tuple[int, ...]) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v1` with novel vector selection heuristics and tunable parameters."""
    n = 8
    if len(el) != n:
        raise ValueError(f"Vector must be {n}-dimensional")
    
    def component_diversity(el: Tuple[int, ...]) -> float:
        """Measures component diversity using the Gini index."""
        counts = np.bincount(el, minlength=3)
        total = len(el)
        p = counts / total
        gini = 1 - sum(p_i**2 for p_i in p)
        return gini
    
    def centrality(el: Tuple[int, ...]) -> float:
        """Measures proximity to the center vector (all 1s)."""
        center = (1,) * n
        distance = sum(abs(e - c) for e, c in zip(el, center))
        return 1 - (distance / (2 * n))
    
    def component_entropy(el: Tuple[int, ...]) -> float:
        """Calculates the Shannon entropy of component distribution."""
        counts = np.bincount(el, minlength=3)
        total = len(el)
        p = counts / total
        entropy = -sum(p_i * np.log2(p_i) for p_i in p if p_i > 0)
        max_entropy = np.log2(3)
        return entropy / max_entropy
    
    def dimensional_spread(el: Tuple[int, ...]) -> float:
        """Measures the spread of non-1 components across dimensions."""
        spread = sum(1 for e in el if e != 1)
        return spread / n
    
    # Calculate individual scores
    diversity_score = component_diversity(el)
    centrality_score = centrality(el)
    entropy_score = component_entropy(el)
    spread_score = dimensional_spread(el)
    
    # Tunable weights
    diversity_weight = tunable([0.4, 0.5, 0.6])
    centrality_weight = tunable([0.2, 0.3, 0.4])
    entropy_weight = tunable([0.1, 0.15, 0.2])
    spread_weight = tunable([0.1, 0.15, 0.2])
    
    # Calculate priority as weighted sum
    priority = (
        diversity_weight * diversity_score +
        centrality_weight * centrality_score +
        entropy_weight * entropy_score +
        spread_weight * spread_score
    )
    
    return priority
```

### Explanation
1. **Component Diversity**: Uses the Gini index to assess how diverse the vector's components are. A higher Gini index indicates greater diversity.
2. **Centrality**: Scores vectors based on their proximity to the center (all 1s). Vectors closer to the center are preferred.
3. **Component Entropy**: Measures the uniformity of component distribution. Higher entropy indicates a more uniform distribution of components.
4. **Dimensional Spread**: Counts how many dimensions have components other than 1. A higher spread suggests the vector is more varied across dimensions.

The function combines these metrics using tunable weights, allowing users to adjust the importance of each metric according to their specific needs. This approach provides a flexible and powerful method for constructing 8-dimensional cap sets.

To address the problem of constructing 8-dimensional cap sets, we need an improved vector selection strategy that prioritizes vectors less likely to form lines with existing ones. The solution introduces a novel priority function that combines multiple heuristics, each with tunable parameters to allow for optimization.

### Approach
The approach involves defining a priority function, `priority_v2`, which evaluates each vector based on three key heuristics:
1. **Balance Score**: Measures how evenly the vector's components are distributed among 0, 1, and 2.
2. **Diversity Score**: Assesses the number of distinct components in the vector.
3. **Boundary Score**: Rewards vectors for having more components at the extremes (0 or 2).

Each heuristic is weighted, allowing for parameter tuning to optimize the selection process. The function combines these scores to determine the priority of each vector, with higher scores indicating a better candidate for inclusion in the cap set.

### Solution Code
```python
import numpy as np
from typing import Tuple

def priority_v2(el: Tuple[int, ...]) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v1` with a novel vector selection strategy."""
    
    n = 8

        raise ValueError(f"Vector must be {n}-dimensional")
    
    # Helper function to calculate the balance score
    def balance_score(vector: Tuple[int, ...], weight: float) -> float:
        counts = np.bincount(vector, minlength=3)
        if np.min(counts) == 0:
            return 0.0
        balance = np.max(counts) / np.min(counts)
        return -balance * weight  # Negative because higher balance means lower score
    
    # Helper function to calculate the diversity score
    def diversity_score(vector: Tuple[int, ...], weight: float) -> float:
        unique_count = len(set(vector))
        return unique_count * weight
    
    # Helper function to calculate the boundary score
    def boundary_score(vector: Tuple[int, ...], weight: float) -> float:
        count = sum(1 for x in vector if x in {0, 2})
        return count * weight
    
    # Combine all scores to get the final priority
    def final_priority(vector: Tuple[int, ...]) -> float:
        # Tunable parameters
        balance_weight = tunable([0.4, 0.5, 0.6])
        diversity_weight = tunable([0.3, 0.4, 0.5])
        boundary_weight = tunable([0.3, 0.4, 0.5])
        
        balance = balance_score(vector, balance_weight)
        diversity = diversity_score(vector, diversity_weight)
        boundary = boundary_score(vector, boundary_weight)
        
        return balance + diversity + boundary
    
    return final_priority(el)
```

### Explanation
- **Balance Score**: This score evaluates how evenly the components 0, 1, and 2 are distributed across the vector. A higher balance (more even distribution) results in a lower score, as it reduces the likelihood of forming lines.
- **Diversity Score**: This score rewards vectors with a higher number of distinct components, promoting diversity which can help in avoiding arithmetic progressions.
- **Boundary Score**: This score prioritizes vectors with more components at the extremes (0 or 2), as these are less likely to form lines compared to vectors with more central components (1).

The function combines these scores using tunable weights, allowing for experimentation with different weightings to optimize the cap set construction process. This approach ensures that the selection of vectors is both balanced and diverse, while also favoring those with components at the extremes, thereby reducing the likelihood of forming lines.

To create an improved Python function for constructing 8-dimensional cap sets, we introduce a novel vector selection strategy with tunable parameters. The new strategy focuses on balancing vector diversity, balance, and centrality while introducing a new component to avoid similar vectors, reducing the risk of forming lines.

### Approach

1. **Vector Diversity and Balance**: We maintain and enhance the existing heuristics for vector diversity, positional diversity, and centrality. These ensure a mix of unique elements, varied positions, and a balanced distribution of values.

2. **Line-Avoidance Heuristic**: Introduce a new component that rewards vectors based on their dissimilarity to existing vectors. This is measured using the Hamming distance, ensuring vectors are sufficiently different to minimize the risk of forming lines.

3. **Tunable Parameters**: Incorporate tunable parameters to adjust the importance of each heuristic. This allows flexibility in balancing between diversity, balance, and avoiding similar vectors.

### Explanation

- **Vector Diversity and Balance**: The diversity function ensures vectors have unique elements, while the balance function ensures a uniform distribution of values across dimensions.

- **Centrality**: This heuristic rewards vectors that are centered around a particular value, helping maintain a balanced set.

- **Sparsity**: This component favors vectors with fewer zeros, promoting a diverse set of vectors.

- **Line-Avoidance**: This new heuristic calculates the similarity between the new vector and existing vectors. A lower similarity score indicates a lower risk of forming lines, thus reducing the likelihood of the new vector contributing to a line formation.

- **Tunable Parameters**: The function includes tunable parameters for each heuristic, allowing users to adjust the importance of each component to optimize the cap set construction.

This approach ensures a more efficient and effective selection of vectors, balancing diversity, balance, and avoiding similar vectors to reduce the risk of line formation.

Create an improved Python function for constructing 8-dimensional cap sets that demonstrates:
Novel vector priority strategy: Design a smarter vector selection strategy.
Parameter tuning points: Mark adjustable parameters using tunable([option1, option2, ...]) wrapper. Examples:
`if axis_balance_weight = tunable([0.1, 0.3, 0.5])`

### Key Features of the `priority_v2` Function:
1. **Balance Score**: Uses an entropy-like measure to assess how evenly the values are distributed among the dimensions.
2. **Uniqueness Score**: Counts the number of unique elements in the vector to encourage diversity in the cap set.
3. **Centrality Score**: Aims to favor vectors closer to the "central" value of 1 in multi-dimensional space, giving an idea of balance towards a desired value.
4. **Risk Score**: Measures the likelihood of forming a line by checking pairs of dimensions for identical values, thus assessing the risk of future collisions.

### Tunable Parameters
- Each of the score components can be tuned, allowing you flexibility in shaping the selection criteria based on your experimental needs.
  
Remember, the `tunable()` function is not implemented in this code, as per your instructions. You can adjust the weighting according to your specific needs after integrating an actual implementation for this function.

Key innovations and tuning points:

1. **Positional Dispersion**:
   - Scores variance of element positions using `position_dispersion`
   - Tunable weights for dispersion impact (`feature_weights['dispersion']`)

2. **Dynamic Balance Ratio**:
   - Adaptive count balancing with Laplace smoothing (`tunable([0.1, 0.5, 1.0])`)
   - Weight controlled by `feature_weights['balance']`

3. **Line Formation Risk**:
   - Detects potential arithmetic sequences with `arithmetic_risk`
   - Penalty strength via `feature_weights['risk_penalty']`

4. **Element Position Entropy**:
   - Measures spatial distribution randomness
   - Tunable weighting (`feature_weights['entropy']`)

5. **Middle Value Handling**:
   - Configurable penalty for 1s using dictionary-based tuning
   - Bonus/penalty amounts exposed in `mid_value_bonus`

6. **Adaptive Diversity Bonus**:
   - Optional diversity component with tunable weight (`tunable([0.0, 0.1, 0.2])`)

This implementation combines multiple novel heuristics while exposing critical parameters for optimization. The tunable parameters allow adjusting the strategy for different parts of the search space during cap set construction.

-- [338.0, 338.0] -- DeepSeek-R1-distill-qwen-32b ----sample--------


To solve this problem, we need to create an improved Python function for constructing 8-dimensional cap sets. The goal is to design a smarter vector selection strategy and expose tuning parameters using a tunable() wrapper. The function should prioritize vectors based on multiple metrics, each with adjustable weights.

### Approach
The approach involves defining a priority function that calculates a score for each vector based on several metrics. These metrics include component diversity, balance, centrality, spread, and entropy. Each metric is weighted, and these weights can be adjusted using tunable parameters. The priority score is a weighted sum of these metrics, allowing for flexibility in the selection strategy.

import numpy as np

    """Improved version of `priority_v1` with novel vector selection heuristics and tunable parameters.

            return 0.0
        probs = counts / total
        entropy = -np.sum(probs * np.log2(probs + 1e-9))  # Avoid log(0)
        return entropy / np.log2(3)  # Normalize to [0,1]

    # Tunable weights for different priority aspects
    diversity_weight = 0.4  # tunable([0.4, 0.5, 0.6])

        spread_weight * spread_score +
        entropy_weight * entropy_score
    )

    return priority
```

### Explanation
The function `priority_v2` calculates a priority score for each vector based on several metrics:
1. **Component Diversity**: Measures how many unique components are present in the vector.
2. **Component Balance**: Assesses how evenly the components are distributed.
3. **Centrality**: Determines how close the vector is to the center (all ones).
4. **Spread**: Evaluates how evenly the values are distributed across dimensions.
5. **Component Entropy**: Measures the randomness of the component distribution.

Each metric is assigned a tunable weight, allowing for adjustment to optimize the selection strategy. The priority score is a weighted sum of these metrics, providing a flexible and adjustable method for selecting vectors in the cap set construction process.

This improved version introduces two novel heuristics:
1. **Orthogonality Avoidance**: Penalizes vectors that align too well with existing vectors, reducing the chance of forming lines.
2. **Arithmetic Progression Avoidance**: Measures how well the vector avoids existing pairs that could form 3-term arithmetic progressions.

The function now includes tunable parameters for all heuristics, allowing users to adjust their influence on the priority score. This flexibility makes the algorithm more adaptable to different strategies for constructing cap sets.

The implementation is practical and non-trivial, combining multiple vector properties to ensure a more robust selection process.

-- [344.0, 350.0] -- DeepSeek-R1-distill-qwen-32b ----sample--------


To solve this problem, we need to design an improved function for constructing 8-dimensional cap sets. The function should prioritize vectors based on a novel strategy that considers multiple intrinsic properties of the vectors, allowing for tunable parameters to optimize the selection process.

### Approach
The approach involves creating a priority function that evaluates each vector based on four key metrics: balance, diversity, sparsity, and line avoidance. Each metric is scored and combined using tunable weights to determine the priority of the vector. The goal is to select vectors that are less likely to form lines, thus contributing to a larger cap set.

1. **Balance Score**: Measures how evenly distributed the elements (0, 1, 2) are in the vector. A more balanced distribution is preferred.
2. **Diversity Score**: Rewards vectors with more unique elements, as they are less likely to form lines.
3. **Sparsity Score**: Favors vectors with more zeros or twos, as these can fix dimensions and reduce the chance of forming lines.
4. **Line Avoidance Score**: Penalizes vectors with more ones, as ones are more likely to be midpoints in lines.

The scores are combined using tunable weights, allowing for flexibility in adjusting the importance of each metric during the optimization process.

### Solution Code

import numpy as np
from typing import Tuple

def priority_v2(el: Tuple[int, ...]) -> float:
    """Improved priority function for constructing 8-dimensional cap sets.

        values indicate the vector should be considered earlier.
    """
    n = 8
    if len(el) != n:
        raise ValueError(f"Vector must be {n}-dimensional")
    
    counts = np.bincount(el, minlength=3)
    count_0, count_1, count_2 = counts
    
    # Compute balance score: higher for more balanced vectors
    imbalance = max(counts) - min(counts)
    balance_score = 1.0 / (imbalance + 1)
    
    # Compute diversity score: higher for more unique elements
    unique = len(set(el))
    diversity_score = unique / 3.0  # Normalized to [0, 1]
    
    # Compute sparsity score: higher for more zeros and twos
    sparsity = (count_0 + count_2) / n
    sparsity_score = sparsity
    
    # Compute line avoidance score: higher for fewer ones
    line_avoidance = (n - count_1) / n
    line_avoidance_score = line_avoidance
    
    # Tunable parameters for combining scores

    diversity_weight = tunable([0.1, 0.2, 0.3])

    line_avoidance_weight = tunable([0.4, 0.5, 0.6])
    
    # Calculate total priority
    total_priority = (
        balance_score * balance_weight +
        diversity_score * diversity_weight +
        sparsity_score * sparsity_weight +
        line_avoidance_score * line_avoidance_weight
    )
    
    return total_priority
```

### Explanation
The function `priority_v2` evaluates each 8-dimensional vector based on four intrinsic properties: balance, diversity, sparsity, and line avoidance. Each property is converted into a score, and these scores are combined using tunable weights to determine the vector's priority. The tunable weights allow for adjusting the importance of each property, enabling the function to be optimized for different scenarios. The higher the priority score, the earlier the vector is considered in the greedy algorithm, aiming to construct a larger cap set by avoiding the formation of lines.

To create an improved Python function for constructing 8-dimensional cap sets, we'll design a smarter vector selection strategy with tunable parameters. The new function, `priority_v2`, will incorporate innovative metrics and allow adjusting their weights to optimize vector selection.

### Approach

1. **Innovative Vector Selection Strategy**:
   - Prioritize vectors that minimize the risk of forming lines with existing vectors in the cap set. This is simulated by a line-avoidance score, though in this function, we'll focus on enhancing existing metrics without direct line computation.
   - Use entropy, unique coordinate count, modular sum, and interaction terms with tunable weights.

2. **Tunable Parameters**:
   - Introduce tunable weights for each metric using the `tunable()` wrapper, allowing flexibility in vector selection.

3. **Enhanced Metrics**:
   - **Entropy**: Measures diversity of vector components.
   - **Unique Coordinate Count**: Rewards vectors with more unique values.
   - **Modular Sum**: Penalizes vectors with sums congruent to 0 modulo 3.
   - **Interaction Terms**: Rewards vectors with diverse pairwise interactions.

### Solution Code

```python
import numpy as np
import itertools
from typing import List, Tuple, Optional

def priority_v2(el: tuple[int, ...]) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v1` with enhanced vector selection strategy and tunable parameters."""
    n = 8  # Number of dimensions

    def entropy(el: Tuple[int, ...]) -> float:
        """Measures the diversity of the vector's values using entropy."""
        counts = {}
        for x in el:
            counts[x] = counts.get(x, 0) + 1
        values = list(counts.values())
        total = sum(values)
        if total == 0:
            return 0.0
        distrib = [v / total for v in values]
        return -sum(p * np.log(p) for p in distrib if p > 0)

    def unique_coord_count(el: Tuple[int, ...]) -> float:
        """Counts how many coordinates have unique values."""
        unique_values = set(el)
        count = 0
        for x in el:
            if el.count(x) == 1:
                count += 1
        return count / n

    def modular_sum(el: Tuple[int, ...]) -> float:
        """Rewards vectors with a modular sum not equal to zero."""
        s = sum(el) % 3
        return 1.0 if s != 0 else 0.5

    def interaction_terms(el: Tuple[int, ...]) -> float:
        """Rewards vectors with diverse pairwise coordinate relationships."""
        count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                a, b = el[i], el[j]
                if a != b and (a + b) % 3 != 0:
                    count += 1
        return count / (n * (n - 1) / 2)

    tunable_params = [
        ('entropy_weight', 0.4),
        ('unique_weight', 0.4),
        ('modular_weight', 0.1),
        ('interaction_weight', 0.1),
    ]

    weights = {name: tunable(weight) for name, weight in tunable_params}

    ent = entropy(el)
    unique = unique_coord_count(el)
    mod = modular_sum(el)
    inter = interaction_terms(el)

    priority = (
        weights['entropy_weight'] * ent +
        weights['unique_weight'] * unique +
        weights['modular_weight'] * mod +
        weights['interaction_weight'] * inter
    )

    # Additional tunable bonuses
    if len(set(el)) == n:
        priority += 0.1
    if sum(el) % 3 == 1:
        priority += 0.03

    return priority
```

### Explanation

1. **Entropy Calculation**: Measures the diversity of vector components using information entropy. Higher entropy indicates more diversity.

2. **Unique Coordinate Count**: Rewards vectors with more unique values, reducing the chance of line formation.

3. **Modular Sum**: Penalizes vectors whose component sum is 0 modulo 3, as they are more likely to form lines.

4. **Interaction Terms**: Rewards vectors with diverse pairwise interactions, enhancing the potential to avoid lines.

5. **Tunable Weights**: Each metric's contribution to the priority score can be adjusted using tunable parameters, allowing optimization for different vector selection strategies.

This approach balances diversity, uniqueness, and modular properties to construct a cap set efficiently, with adjustable parameters for optimal performance.

-- [345.0, 350.0] -- DeepSeek-R1 ----sample--------


To solve this problem, we need to design an improved priority function for constructing 8-dimensional cap sets using a greedy algorithm. The priority function should determine the order in which vectors are added to the cap set, aiming to avoid the formation of lines (three vectors that form an arithmetic progression). The solution involves combining several heuristic measures to evaluate each vector's potential contribution to the cap set, with tunable parameters to optimize performance.

### Approach
The approach involves the following key heuristics to evaluate each vector's priority:
1. **Axis Balance**: Measure how evenly the values 0, 1, and 2 are distributed across the vector. A balanced distribution is preferred.
2. **Sum Modulo 3**: Prefer vectors where the sum of coordinates is a multiple of 3, as such vectors are less likely to form lines.
3. **Pattern Avoidance**: Penalize vectors that contain consecutive arithmetic progressions, which are potential line segments.
4. **Transition Count**: Reward vectors with frequent changes between consecutive elements, promoting diversity.
5. **Centrality**: Measure how close the vector is to a predefined template, which is chosen to spread values evenly.
6. **Diversity**: Reward vectors with a higher number of unique elements.

Each heuristic is combined with tunable weights and parameters to allow optimization based on empirical performance.

### Solution Code

    axis_balance_score = -np.std(counts)  # Lower std is better
    axis_balance_weight = tunable([0.2, 0.3, 0.4])  # Tuning point

    # Heuristic 2: Sum Modulo 3 (prefer sum ≡ 0 mod 3)
    sum_mod3 = sum(el) % 3
    sum_mod3_score = 1.0 if sum_mod3 == 0 else 0.0
    sum_mod3_weight = tunable([0.0, 0.1, 0.2])  # Tuning point

    template = tunable([  # Tuning point for template selection
        (1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0),
        (0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1),
        (2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1),
        (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
    ])
    distance = sum(abs(el[i] - template[i]) for i in range(n))
    max_distance = 2 * n
    centrality_score = 1.0 - (distance / max_distance)  # Higher is closer
    centrality_weight = tunable([0.3, 0.4, 0.5])  # Tuning point

    # Heuristic 6: Element Diversity (unique count)

    diversity_score = unique_elements / n  # Normalized to [0,1]

        transition_score * transition_weight +
        centrality_score * centrality_weight +
        diversity_score * diversity_weight
    )
    
    return total_score
```

### Explanation
The provided solution combines multiple heuristics to evaluate each vector's suitability for inclusion in the cap set:
1. **Axis Balance**: Measures the balance of 0, 1, and 2 values using the standard deviation of their counts.
2. **Sum Modulo 3**: Favors vectors whose coordinate sums are multiples of 3, reducing line formation risk.
3. **Pattern Avoidance**: Penalizes vectors with consecutive arithmetic progressions, which are potential line segments.
4. **Transition Count**: Encourages frequent changes between consecutive elements to enhance diversity.
5. **Centrality**: Measures proximity to a predefined template vector to ensure even value distribution.
6. **Diversity**: Rewards vectors with more unique elements to avoid clustering.

Each heuristic's contribution is weighted by tunable parameters, allowing optimization through hyperparameter tuning. This approach balances multiple aspects of vector structure to maximize cap set size while minimizing line formation.

To address the problem of constructing larger 8-dimensional cap sets, we introduce an improved priority function, `priority_v2`, which employs novel heuristics and tunable parameters to guide the selection process. The function prioritizes vectors based on their likelihood to contribute to avoiding lines, considering factors such as midpoint potential, coordinate balance, pattern uniqueness, and entropy.

### Approach
The approach involves defining a priority function that combines multiple heuristics, each contributing to the overall score of a vector. The heuristics are designed to favor vectors that are less likely to form lines with others, either by being midpoints or by having diverse coordinate distributions. The function uses tunable parameters to allow for experimentation with different weights and settings.

        for i in range(n - pattern_length + 1):
            pattern = tuple(vector[i:i+pattern_length])
            patterns[pattern] = patterns.get(pattern, 0) + 1

        if len(probs) == 0:
            return 0.0
        entropy = -np.sum(probs * np.log2(probs))
        return entropy * weight
    
    # Tunable parameters
    weights = {
        'midpoint_potential': tunable([0.1, 0.3, 0.5]),
        'coordinate_balance': tunable([0.2, 0.4, 0.6]),
        'pattern_uniqueness': tunable([0.1, 0.2, 0.3]),

    }

    # Calculate each component
    mp_score = midpoint_potential(el, weights['midpoint_potential'])
    cb_score = coordinate_balance(el, weights['coordinate_balance'])
    pu_score = pattern_uniqueness(el, weights['pattern_uniqueness'], pattern_length)
    ent_score = entropy(el, weights['entropy'])
    
    # Combine scores to get the final priority
    total_priority = mp_score + cb_score + pu_score + ent_score
    
    return total_priority
```

### Explanation
1. **Midpoint Potential**: This heuristic penalizes vectors with more '1's, as they are more likely to be midpoints of lines. Vectors with fewer '1's are prioritized.

2. **Coordinate Balance**: Vectors with a balanced distribution of 0s, 1s, and 2s are rewarded. This helps in avoiding vectors that might lead to lines due to their skewed distribution.

3. **Pattern Uniqueness**: Vectors with repetitive patterns are penalized. By avoiding such vectors, we reduce the likelihood of forming lines.

4. **Entropy**: Higher entropy in the coordinate distribution is rewarded, as it indicates a more spread-out distribution, which is less likely to form lines.

The function combines these heuristics using tunable weights, allowing for experimentation with different strategies. The tunable parameters enable adjusting the influence of each heuristic and the pattern length used in detecting repetitions, making the function adaptable to different scenarios.

This approach aims to improve the effectiveness of the greedy algorithm in constructing larger cap sets by prioritizing vectors that contribute to avoiding lines, thus enhancing the overall performance.

Create an improved Python function for constructing 8-dimensional cap sets that demonstrates:
Novel vector priority strategy: Design a smarter vector selection strategy.
Parameter tuning points: Mark adjustable parameters using tunable([option1, option2, ...]) wrapper. Examples:
`if axis_balance_weight = tunable([0.1, 0.3, 0.5])`
`sorted(elements, key=lambda x: tunable([x.diversity, x.centrality]))`
Focus first on innovative vector selection heuristics, then expose tuning parameters via `tunable()`. Keep implementation practical but non-trivial. 

Note:
1. Do not generate the `tunable()` function implementation.
2. Any helper functions should be defined within the priority function.

    # Directional balance (forward vs backward patterns)

        center_bias * (el[3] + el[4])/2  # Middle positions get extra weight
    )

```

Key innovations:
1. **Position-sensitive scoring**: Uses tunable weights for different vector positions
2. **Run pattern analysis**: Considers both maximal run length and number of digit transitions
3. **Directional balance**: Checks similarity between forward and reverse patterns
4. **Central position bias**: Explicit bonus for middle elements (positions 3-4)
5. **Dynamic composition**: Combines 6 tunable parameters with novel metrics

Tuning points exposed via `tunable()`:
- Position weighting strategies
- Balance vs transition quality tradeoff
- Run pattern risk tolerance
- Directional symmetry importance
- Central position bonus strength

This implementation focuses on patterns that correlate with line formation probabilities while maintaining computational efficiency. The position-sensitive scoring and directional checks provide novel dimensions for optimization compared to previous approaches.

Tuning points exposed:

- Reference vector for distance calculation
- Per-axis weighting scheme
- AP collision sensitivity factor
- Balance strictness coefficient

Create an improved Python function for constructing 8-dimensional cap sets that demonstrates:
Novel vector priority strategy: Design a smarter vector selection strategy.
Parameter tuning points: Mark adjustable parameters using tunable([option1, option2, ...]) wrapper. Examples:
`if axis_balance_weight = tunable([0.1, 0.3, 0.5])`

Focus first on innovative vector selection heuristics, then expose tuning parameters via `tunable()`. Keep implementation practical but non-trivial. 

Note:
1. Do not generate the `tunable()` function implementation.
2. Any helper functions should be defined within the priority function.

            if (a + b + c) % 3 == 0 and not (a == b == c):
                count += 1
        return count / 56  # Normalized by maximum possible trios

    def axis_balance(vector: Tuple[int, ...]) -> float:
        """Rewards vectors that balance digit distribution across coordinates."""
        hist = [0, 0, 0]
        for x in vector:
            hist[x] += 1
        return 1 - max(hist)/len(vector)  # 1 when perfectly balanced

    def modular_tension(vector: Tuple[int, ...]) -> float:

        s = sum(vector) % 3
        return [0.3, 0.6, 0.1][s]  # tunable([[...]])

    def differential_spread(vector: Tuple[int, ...]) -> float:
        """Measures pairwise value differences across coordinates."""
        unique_pairs = 0
        for i, j in itertools.combinations(range(8), 2):
            if vector[i] != vector[j]:
                unique_pairs += abs(vector[i] - vector[j]) % 3
        return unique_pairs / (3*28)  # Max difference per pair is 3

    # Tunable parameters
    geometric_weight = tunable([0.4, 0.5, 0.6])  # Weight for line trio penalty
    balance_weight = tunable([0.2, 0.3, 0.4])    # Axis balance importance
    tension_weight = tunable([0.1, 0.15, 0.2])    # Modular tension impact
    spread_weight = tunable([0.05, 0.1, 0.15])    # Differential spread factor

    # Calculate components
    penalty = line_trio_penalty(el)
    balance = axis_balance(el)
    tension = modular_tension(el)
    spread = differential_spread(el)

    # Base score calculation
    score = (balance_weight * balance +
             tension_weight * tension +
             spread_weight * spread -
             geometric_weight * penalty)

    # Dynamic bonuses with tunable parameters
    if len(set(el)) == 3:
        score += tunable([0.08, 0.12, 0.15])  # Full diversity bonus
        
    if sum(1 for x in el if x == 1) >= 3:  # Central value cluster bonus
        score += tunable([0.05, 0.07])
        
    if len([x for x in el if x != 0]) >= 5:  # Non-zero activation bonus
        score += tunable([0.03, 0.05])

    return score
```

Key innovations:

1. **Geometric Line Penalty** (`line_trio_penalty`):
   - Directly measures potential line-forming trios in 3D subspaces
   - Tunable weight controls emphasis on geometric avoidance

2. **Dynamic Modular Tension**:
   - Prefers vectors creating non-zero sum configurations
   - Reward distribution tunable via parameterized returns

3. **Differential Spread**:
   - Measures pairwise coordinate differences both in value and modular space
   - Captures local diversity between coordinate pairs

4. **Adaptive Bonuses**:
   - Multiple conditional bonuses with tunable magnitudes
   - Rewards specific structural properties empirically useful in cap sets

Tuning points exposed via `tunable()`:
- Weighting between geometric avoidance and balance
- Impact of modular sum properties
- Bonus magnitudes for diversity/clustering
- Tradeoff between local and global coordination

This strategy combines geometric line prevention with statistical balance and modular considerations, while allowing parameter exploration through clearly marked tuning points.

        (np.mean(el) - mean_preference)**2 * tunable([-0.5, -1.0, -1.5])  # Penalize deviation from preferred mean
    ]

    # Combine scores using dynamic weighting
    return sum(scores) * tunable([0.9, 1.0, 1.1])  # Overall scaling factor
```

Key innovations:

1. **Progression Risk Analysis**:
   - Explicit penalty for coordinates likely to form midpoints (value=1)
   - Pattern variation scoring to avoid repeating subsequences

2. **Geometric Considerations**:
   - Value spread metric favoring coordinates distant from common midpoint values
   - Dimension collision penalty for adjacent matching coordinates

3. **Tunable Parameters**:
   - 7 tunable weights controlling feature importance
   - Adjustable preferred mean value for coordinate distribution
   - Final score scaling factor for sensitivity control

4. **Dynamic Interactions**:
   - Quadratic penalty for deviation from preferred coordinate mean
   - Combined weighting of complementary features (spread vs balance)

This implementation balances computational efficiency with sophisticated combinatorial analysis, focusing on features that correlate with progression avoidance in high-dimensional spaces.

Key innovations:

1. **Progression Risk Detection**:
   - Actively looks for potential arithmetic progression patterns
   - Counts risky delta patterns between consecutive elements

2. **Symmetry Scoring**:
   - Penalizes mirror-symmetric vectors that might form structured progressions
   - Configurable impact through tunable weight

3. **Dynamic Entropy Weighting**:
   - Uses Shannon entropy instead of Gini for better distribution measurement
   - Tunable exponent for non-linear effects

4. **Cluster Penalty**:
   - Discourages consecutive identical digits
   - Helps break up repetitive patterns that might form lines

5. **Central Digit Control**:
   - Separate weighting for frequency of 1s (middle digit)
   - Negative weight helps limit central values prone to forming lines

Tuning parameters are exposed through the `tunable()` wrapper for:
- Relative importance of entropy vs pattern risks
- Symmetry tolerance levels
- Cluster penalty strictness
- Middle digit frequency control

This implementation balances immediate pattern detection with statistical distribution properties, while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for large cap set generation.

Create an improved Python function for constructing 8-dimensional cap sets that demonstrates:
Novel vector priority strategy: Design a smarter vector selection strategy.
Parameter tuning points: Mark adjustable parameters using tunable([option1, option2, ...]) wrapper. Examples:
`if axis_balance_weight = tunable([0.1, 0.3, 0.5])`
`sorted(elements, key=lambda x: tunable([x.diversity, x.centrality]))`
Focus first on innovative vector selection heuristics, then expose tuning parameters via `tunable()`. Keep implementation practical but non-trivial. 

Note:
1. Do not generate the `tunable()` function implementation.
2. Any helper functions should be defined within the priority function.




-- [342.0, 350.0] -- Deepseek-R1-distill-qwen-7b ----sample--------


To create an improved Python function for constructing 8-dimensional cap sets, we need to enhance the vector selection strategy. The new function, `priority_v2`, incorporates advanced features and tunable parameters to prioritize vectors effectively.

### Approach
The improved function `priority_v2` includes the following features:
1. **Component Balance**: Ensures vectors with balanced component distributions.
2. **Diversity Across Components**: Maximizes the variety of values in the vector.
3. **Centrality**: Prefers vectors closer to a central reference vector.
4. **Risk Minimization**: Reduces the likelihood of forming lines with existing vectors.

The function uses tunable parameters to adjust the importance of each feature, allowing flexibility in the selection strategy.

### Solution Code

```python
def priority_v2(el: tuple[int, ...]) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v1` with advanced vector selection strategy.
    
    Args:
        el: An 8-dimensional vector (tuple) with components in {0, 1, 2}.
    
    Returns:
        Priority score determining selection order in greedy algorithm. Higher
        values indicate the vector should be considered earlier.
    """
    if len(el) != 8:
        raise ValueError("Vector must be 8-dimensional.")
    
    # Tunable parameters
    axis_balance_weight = tunable([0.1, 0.3, 0.5])
    diversity_weight = tunable([0.1, 0.3, 0.5])
    centrality_weight = tunable([0.1, 0.3, 0.5])
    risk_weight = tunable([0.1, 0.3, 0.5])
    
    n = 8
    
    # Component balance: how evenly distributed the components are
    from collections import Counter
    counts = Counter(el)
    total = n
    balance = 1 - max(abs(count - total / 3) for count in counts.values()) / (total / 3)

    # Risk minimization: likelihood of forming a line with existing vectors
    # This is a simplified heuristic
    risk = 0
    for i in range(n):
        current = el[i]
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if el[j] == current:
                risk += 1
    # Normalize by the number of pairs
    num_pairs = n * (n - 1) / 2
    risk = risk / num_pairs if num_pairs != 0 else 0
    
    # Combine scores with tunable weights
    total_priority = (
        balance * axis_balance_weight +
        diversity * diversity_weight +
        centrality * centrality_weight -
        risk * risk_weight
    )
    
    return total_priority
```

### Explanation
1. **Component Balance**: Calculates how evenly the components are distributed. A perfectly balanced vector has each component appearing approximately the same number of times.
2. **Diversity Across Components**: Measures the variety of values in the vector. More unique values increase diversity.
3. **Centrality**: Determines how close the vector is to a central reference vector. Vectors closer to the center are preferred.
4. **Risk Minimization**: Heuristically estimates the risk of forming a line with existing vectors by counting shared components in each dimension.

The tunable parameters allow adjusting the importance of each feature, providing flexibility in the selection strategy. This approach aims to construct a larger cap set by strategically selecting vectors that balance diversity, balance, centrality, and risk.

        weights['transition'] * transition_ratio +
        weights['cluster_penalty'] * cluster_penalty +
        weights['dimension_balance'] * dimension_balance +
        weights['line_risk'] * line_risk +
        weights['symmetry'] * symmetry_bonus +
        weights['skew'] * digit_skew_penalty(counts)
    )
    
    return priority
```

Key innovations and tuning points:

1. **Transition Diversity**: Rewards vectors with frequent digit changes between adjacent coordinates using a normalized ratio. Tunable weight controls impact.

2. **Cluster Penalty**: Applies quadratic penalty for longest same-digit sequence. Weight sign/direction is fixed (negative impact), magnitude is tunable.

3. **Dimension Balance**: Offers choice between two balance metrics (standard deviation vs variance reciprocal) via `tunable()` selection.

4. **Line Risk Heuristic**: Estimates collision potential using same-digit pairs. Tunable negative weight controls risk aversion.

5. **Symmetry Bonus**: Optional reward for palindromic vectors via binary check. Tunable bonus amount.

6. **Digit Skew Analysis**: Sophisticated penalty for unbalanced distributions using squared deviations. Tunable impact factor.

This implementation provides multiple optimization levers:
- 6 tunable weight parameters
- Choice between balance metrics
- Combination of linear and non-linear penalties
- Both positive and negative scoring components

The priorities balance immediate collision prevention (line risk, clusters) with long-term set quality (transitions, balance, symmetry). The tunable parameters allow adaptation to different optimization strategies and problem space characteristics.

Key improvements and novel aspects:

1. Added `line_avoidance` heuristic:
   - Penalizes vectors that are part of arithmetic lines in 8 dimensions
   - Uses a simplified line detection method by checking variations in subsets of coordinates
   - Helps maintain cap set properties by avoiding configurations that would create arithmetic progressions

2. Tunable parameters:
   - Added `line_avoidance` weight with a default value of 1.0
   - All weights are tunable parameters that can be adjusted during optimization
   - Easy to extend by adding more geometric heuristics

3. Enhanced vector selection strategy:
   - Combines multiple heuristics for better performance
   - Focuses on creating a balanced distribution of coordinates
   - Penalizes repetitive patterns and midpoints of lines
   - Rewards vectors with high entropy in coordinate distribution

4. Practical implementation:
   - All helper functions are defined within the main function
   - Efficient numpy operations for vector analysis
   - Simplified line detection heuristic that can be extended
   - Clear and maintainable code structure

This improved version provides a better balance between exploring promising vectors and maintaining cap set properties while allowing for easy tuning of the vector selection strategy through adjustable parameters.

Key innovations and tuning points:

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - Detects arithmetic progression patterns in adjacent coordinates
   - Strength controlled by `pattern_weight`
   - Prefers vectors breaking local progression patterns

2. **Dimension Balance**:
   - Measures value distribution per coordinate
   - Weight adjusted via `balance_weight`
   - Encourages coordinates to maintain balanced value distributions

3. **Triplet Potential**:
   - Counts coordinate pairs that could form forbidden triplets
   - Penalty strength set by `triplet_weight`
   - Actively discouragoves vectors likely to enable future line formations

4. **Dynamic Bonuses**:
   - `uniqueness_bonus` promotes vectors with diverse values
   - Modular sum preference tuned via residue class selection
   - Parameterized bonus amounts for special cases

Tuning parameters exposed through `tunable()`:
- Relative weights of different heuristics
- Pattern detection sensitivity
- Preferred modular arithmetic properties
- Bonus/penalty amounts for special conditions

This implementation balances immediate vector characteristics with potential future conflict avoidance, while maintaining practical computational complexity suitable for 8-dimensional space exploration.

Create an improved Python function for constructing 8-dimensional cap sets that demonstrates:
Novel vector priority strategy: Design a smarter vector selection strategy.
Parameter tuning points: Mark adjustable parameters using tunable([option1, option2, ...]) wrapper. Examples:
`if axis_balance_weight = tunable([0.1, 0.3, 0.5])`
`sorted(elements, key=lambda x: tunable([x.diversity, x.centrality]))`
Focus first on innovative vector selection heuristics, then expose tuning parameters via `tunable()`. Keep implementation practical but non-trivial. 

Note:
1. Do not generate the `tunable()` function implementation.
2. Any helper functions should be defined within the priority function.

To create an improved Python function for constructing 8-dimensional cap sets, we will design a smarter vector selection strategy with parameter tuning points. The new function, `priority_v2`, incorporates advanced heuristics and tunable parameters to enhance the selection process. Below is the implementation:

This implementation introduces several advanced features:

1. **Enhanced Heuristics**: Improved versions of existing heuristics with tunable parameters.
2. **Risk Assessment**: Incorporates the risk of line formation with existing vectors.
3. **Novelty Measure**: Adds a measure of how novel a vector is compared to others in the set.
4. **Dynamic Template**: Uses a template vector to encourage diversity and balance.
5. **Tunable Parameters**: Multiple tunable parameters allow customization of the algorithm's behavior.

To use this function, you would need to provide the list of existing vectors in the cap set. The tunable parameters can be adjusted based on specific requirements or experimental results to optimize the performance of the cap set construction.
